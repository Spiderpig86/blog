Well, you're right, it's definitely not the most interesting thing in the world. Since I'm taking a course of offensive security, I <em>kinda</em> need to at least understand the basics of it -- mainly to understand program disassembling for CTF.</p>\n<p>So far, there aren't too many simple guides on learning x86 online compared to other languages. So hopefully, this will be a quick and easy guide for you to follow to learn the very basics of x86. ðŸ˜„</p>\n<h2 id=\"what\">What is x86?</h2>\n<p><em>Worse than MIPS</em>. Just kidding. x86 is a variant of <strong>Assembly</strong> that is commonly written for x86-64 processors which are CISC processors (common in most desktop computers today). x86 is more complex than, let's say, MIPS in the sense that it is designed to complete tasks with only a few instructions rather than using more basic instructions <a href=\"#references\">[1]</a>.</p>\n<p>For example, CISC architectures come with a built-in instruction that performs multiplication without breaking it up into a series of smaller instructions. In the RISC approach, multiplication is actually broken up into a series of a few instructions <a href=\"#references\">[2]</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\"><span class=\"token comment\">; CISC approach</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">; Imagine if dval1 = 0x5 and dval2 = 0x6</span>\nmov <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, dval1 <span class=\"token comment\">; Move the first value to accumulator</span>\nmul dval2 <span class=\"token comment\">; Multiply into eax</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>In the RISC approach, it is broken up into a series of other steps.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">LOAD A, <span class=\"token number\">2</span>\nLOAD B, <span class=\"token number\">3</span>\nPROD A, B\nSTORE A, RES</code></pre></div>\n<h2 id=\"components\">Program Components</h2>\n<p>Before we get started with the x86 language, first we must understand the main sections of a program written in C. This will be a very brief guide since there is plenty of info online. Note that what I will be talking about is the 32-bit variant of the x86 architecture.</p>\n<h3>Heap</h3>\n<p>The <strong>heap</strong> is a section of <strong>unmanaged</strong> memory (in Java, there's GC so technically it is managed there) that is allocated by the operating system. The OS uses the <code class=\"language-text\">sysbrk</code> syscall to allocate memory from the requesting function. Unlike the stack, memory is not invalidated when the function returns which leads to memory leaks. To avoid this, in C you would release memory with <code class=\"language-text\">free()</code> after a call to <code class=\"language-text\">malloc()</code> or one of its variants. The eap grows <strong>upward</strong> towards higher memory addresses.</p>\n<h3>Stack</h3>\n<p>This refers to the region of memory that is allocated to the process <strong>primarily to implement functions</strong>. This is managed in the sense that the variables created remain local to the function it resides and is invalidated once the function exits (when the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_register\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stack pointer</a> moves up). The values are still there, but they will be overwritten by the contents of the next function call's <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10057443/explain-the-concept-of-a-stack-frame-in-a-nutshell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stack frame</a>. Two x86 registers that deal with this are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">esp</code> (extended stack pointer) - points to the top of the stack where <code class=\"language-text\">push</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">pop</code> will decrement and increment the stack pointer respectively. <code class=\"language-text\">push</code> adds an element to the top of the stack while <code class=\"language-text\">pop</code> removes the element at the top of the stack.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">ebp</code> (extended base pointer) - points to the start of the current <strong>stack frame</strong>, which is the space allocated for a function call. The <code class=\"language-text\">call</code> instruction pushes the current instruction pointer onto the stack.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that the stack grows <strong>downward</strong> towards lower memory addresses. This is also where global and static variables are declared.</p>\n<h3 id=\"registers\">Registers</h3>\n<p>These are small storage units located directly in the processor for quick access to intermediate values in function calls. It is known as L0 cache and it is located at the highest level in the <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-hierarchy-design-and-its-characteristics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">memory hierarchy</a>.</p>\n<p>There are six 32-bit general purpose registers in the x86 architecture <a href=\"#references\">[3]</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">eax</code> (extended accumulator register) - used for storing return values for functions and special register for certain calculations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">mov <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token number\">3</span>  <span class=\"token comment\">; Set eax to 3</span>\nret <span class=\"token comment\">; Return</span></code></pre></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ebx</code> (extended base register) - often set to commonly used values to speed up calculations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ecx</code> (extended counter register) - used as a function parameter or a loop counter. Generally used with <em>for loops</em> as the counter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">edx</code> (extended data register) - also used as a function parameter register like <code class=\"language-text\">ecx</code> and storing <strong>short-term variables</strong> within a function.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">esi</code> (extended source index register) - register that points to the where the \"source\" is located in memory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">edi</code> (extended data index register) - similar to <code class=\"language-text\">esi</code>, but it points to the destination. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ebp</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">esp</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">eip</code> are all known as <strong>reserved</strong> registers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"instructions\">Instructions</h2>\n<h3>Format</h3>\n<p>There are essentially two schools of thought for instruction format: the <strong>AT&#x26;T syntax</strong> and the <strong>Intel syntax</strong>.</p>\n<p>In short, the difference is that for the <strong>AT&#x26;T syntax</strong>, the source register is on the left side and the destination register is on the right side while it is the opposite for the <strong>Intel syntax</strong>.</p>\n<p>Instructions typically follow 2 forms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">op arg</code> - there is an operation with only one argument specified.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">op arg1, arg2</code> - there is an operation with two arguments specified, separated by a comma.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As an example with the <code class=\"language-text\">mov</code> instruction, it copies the value that is stored by the second argument into the first argument.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">mov arg1, arg2</code></pre></div>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/images/x86/x86-add.PNG\" alt=\"syntax\"></p>\n<p>Although it is called <code class=\"language-text\">mov</code>, it actually <strong>copies</strong> instead, meaning that the value stored in <code class=\"language-text\">arg2</code> is actually still there. However, there are some caveats with this specific instruction in general discussed in the next section.</p>\n<h3>Dereferencing</h3>\n<p>The caveat comes when you are trying to get values from the stack.</p>\n<p>When you are trying to get values from the stack, let's say moving a local variable at <code class=\"language-text\">ebp - 12 (0xC)</code> with a value of 42, you would expect that you would get the value that is stored at that location into <code class=\"language-text\">eax</code>. This means that <code class=\"language-text\">eax</code> should have the value of 42 right?</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">mov <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token register variable\">ebp</span><span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token number\">0xC</span></code></pre></div>\n<p><strong>WRONG</strong></p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ebp - 0xC</code> is an address that refers to where 42 is stored in memory. Simply calling <code class=\"language-text\">mov</code> will move that address into <code class=\"language-text\">eax</code>, but not 42. If you know C, you know that we would need to <strong>dereference</strong> a pointer to get the value at that location. In x86, a similar idea also exists where we can think of using the square bracket notation as a dereference operator.</p>\n<p>So to get 42, we would run this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">mov <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">ebp</span><span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token number\">0xC</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/images/x86/x86-deref.PNG\" alt=\"dereferencing\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"math\">Math</h2>\nOf course, x86 supports the basic mathematical operators that you would need to perform more complex computations.\n<p><strong>Addition</strong></p>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">add</code> instruction is a binary operation that adds two given registers with the format <code class=\"language-text\">add arg1, arg2</code> which is the same as <code class=\"language-text\">arg1 = arg1 + arg2</code>. The first and second arguments are summed and stored in the first argument.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">add <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token number\">0x5</span></code></pre></div>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/images/x86/x86-add.PNG\" alt=\"adding\"></p>\n<p>The instruction above adds the value in <code class=\"language-text\">%eax</code> with 5 and stores it back in <code class=\"language-text\">%eax</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Subtraction</strong></p>\n<p>This is a binary operation that subtracts the second argument from the first: <code class=\"language-text\">sub arg1, arg2</code> is the same as <code class=\"language-text\">arg1 = arg1 - arg2</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">sub <span class=\"token register variable\">esp</span>, <span class=\"token number\">0x4</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The instruction above moves the stack pointer down 4 bytes.\nThis can also be done by adding a negative value with a lower overhead.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/images/x86/x86-sub.PNG\" alt=\"subtracting\"></p>\n<p><strong>Multiplication</strong></p>\n<p>Multiplication is a bit more complex since it comes with several varying instructions.\nAlso, its destination register varies depending on the memory size of the value you are multiplying with.</p>\n<p>*Note: The terminology here is different than with other architectures. A <strong>word</strong> is 16 bits (size of the register) and a <strong>doubleword</strong> is 32 bits.*</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Multiplying 2 bytes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is a common case where we move one of the operands into register <code class=\"language-text\">%AX</code>. Then, we call <code class=\"language-text\">mul &lt;arg2&gt;</code> which would perform <code class=\"language-text\">%AX = %AX * arg2</code>, where <code class=\"language-text\">arg2</code> is some register and <strong>not</strong> an immediate.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Multiplying 2 words (16 bits)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This operation performs multiplication with two 16 bit values.</li>\n<li>The multiplicand, or number being multiplied, is stored in the <code class=\"language-text\">%AX</code> register and the multiplier is a word stored in memory or another register.</li>\n<li>\n<p>The syntax is similar to before, where we call <code class=\"language-text\">mul &lt;arg2&gt;</code> which performs <code class=\"language-text\">%(DX:AX) = %AX &amp; arg2</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The result is actually stored in two registers. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Since this allows for much larger results, the product of two words can result in a doubleword, which means it needs two registers to store the entire result.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">%DX</code> holds the upper 16 bits of the result while <code class=\"language-text\">%AX</code> holds the bottom 16 bits.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Multiplying 2 doublewords (32 bits)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The idea is similar here, but we use the <strong>extended</strong> versions of registers such as <code class=\"language-text\">%EAX</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">%EDX</code>.</li>\n<li>This is also called as <code class=\"language-text\">mul &lt;arg2&gt;</code>.</li>\n<li>\n<p>the result of this could be a <code class=\"language-text\">qword</code> or <strong>quadword</strong>, so we would need to use 2 <em>extended</em> registers to store the result.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">%(EDX:EAX) = %EAX * arg2</code>.</li>\n<li>Both <code class=\"language-text\">%EDX</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">%EAX</code> store 32 bits.</li>\n<li>Like before, <code class=\"language-text\">%EDX</code> stores the upper 32 bits and <code class=\"language-text\">%EAX</code> stores the lower 32 bits.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Of course there is <code class=\"language-text\">imul</code>, which handles <strong>signed multiplication</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Division</strong></p>\n<p>Like with multiplication, division also has the same rules for dealing with different size divisors</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Divisor is 1 byte</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, we place our dividend (number we are dividing into) in <code class=\"language-text\">%AX</code>.</li>\n<li>The divisor is then another register or memory location we specify that has the divisor, so the operation works like this: <code class=\"language-text\">%AX / arg2</code>.</li>\n<li>The result will be stored in <strong>two</strong> registers: <code class=\"language-text\">%AL</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">%AH</code> which store the quotient and remainder respectively.</li>\n<li>To perform this, call <code class=\"language-text\">div &lt;arg2&gt;</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Divisor is 1 word</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Here, the main difference is that the dividend (32 bits) is placed into the <code class=\"language-text\">%(DX:AX)</code> registers where the upper 16 bits are in <code class=\"language-text\">%DX</code> and the lower 16 bits are in <code class=\"language-text\">%AX</code>.</li>\n<li>After dividing, the 16-bit quotient goes into <code class=\"language-text\">%AX</code> and the 16-bit remainder goes into <code class=\"language-text\">%DX</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Divisor is a doubleword</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The dividend here is assumed to be 64 bits stored along the <code class=\"language-text\">%(EDX:EAX)</code> registers.</li>\n<li>After dividing, the quotient goes into <code class=\"language-text\">%EAX</code> and the remainder goes into <code class=\"language-text\">%EDX</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"stackops\">Stack Based Operations</h2>\n<p>Stack based operators are designed to manipulate registers that correspond with the stack pointer, such as <code class=\"language-text\">%esp</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">%ebp</code>.\nKeep in mind that the stack pointer grows downward in memory, so the \"top\" of the stack is really at the bottom.</p>\n<p><strong>Push</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">push</code> instruction is designed to put stuff on the top of the stack.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>How it accomplishes this is by decrementing <code class=\"language-text\">%esp</code> by 4 bytes (to allocate space for an address on 32 bit systems) and then places the value inside those 4 bytes.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">push &lt;arg&gt;</code></pre></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pop</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">pop</code> instruction is used to pop or remove data from the top of the stack pointed by <code class=\"language-text\">%esp</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This works by incrementing <code class=\"language-text\">%esp</code> by 4 bytes (on 32 bit systems) and copies the value to the corresponding register.</li>\n<li>\n<p>The actual data isn't cleared itself on the stack, but since the stack pointer is above it, the data will be overwritten the next time the stack pointer goes past there.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">pop &lt;register&gt;</code></pre></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/images/x86/x86-stack.PNG\" alt=\"stack\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"lea\">Lea</h2>\n<p>This instruction stands for <strong>load effective address</strong>.</p>\n<p>It places the address of the corresponding value specified in the second argument and places it into the register specified by the first argument.</p>\n<p>The instruction was mainly included to add support to higher level languages like C where it wants the address of some value whether they are arrays or structs. It would be equivalent to the <code class=\"language-text\">&amp;</code> operator in C.\nLet's say we have a struct defined in C like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"c\"><pre class=\"language-c\"><code class=\"language-c\"><span class=\"token keyword\">struct</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Point</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">int</span> x<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">int</span> y<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">int</span> z<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>If we were to access the z coordinate of an array of <code class=\"language-text\">Points</code> inside some for loop, we would run something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"c\"><pre class=\"language-c\"><code class=\"language-c\"><span class=\"token keyword\">int</span> z <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> points<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>i<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>z<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>In x86, the equivalent statement would be:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">MOV <span class=\"token register variable\">EDX</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">EBX</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token register variable\">EAX</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>Recall that the <code class=\"language-text\">MOV</code> instruction is used for moving values from the second argument to the first.</li>\n<li>The brackets are used as a <em>dereference</em> operator to get the associated value at that address.</li>\n<li>We are assuming that <code class=\"language-text\">%EBX</code> contains the base address of the array and <code class=\"language-text\">%EAX</code> contains the counter variable.</li>\n<li>Assuming a <strong>4-byte alignment</strong>, we multiply the counter <code class=\"language-text\">%EAX</code> by <code class=\"language-text\">12</code> since the <code class=\"language-text\">Point</code> struct has a size of <code class=\"language-text\">12</code> bytes (from 3 32-bit integers).</li>\n<li>\n<p>The offset to get the <code class=\"language-text\">z</code> variable is <code class=\"language-text\">8</code> bytes since there are 2 preceding integers, <code class=\"language-text\">x</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">y</code>.\nNow that's great for getting the value we want, but what if we just wanted the actual address in memory.\nIn C, the <code class=\"language-text\">&amp;</code> operator comes in handy and we can write something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"c\"><pre class=\"language-c\"><code class=\"language-c\"><span class=\"token keyword\">int</span><span class=\"token operator\">*</span> p <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;</span>points<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>i<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>z<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The code above will get the address of the <code class=\"language-text\">z</code> varible in the struct and store that in an int pointer <code class=\"language-text\">p</code>.\nBelow is the is the compiled version of the code, where we load the address into register <code class=\"language-text\">%ESI</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">LEA <span class=\"token register variable\">ESI</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">EBX</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token register variable\">EAX</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/images/x86/x86-lea.PNG\" alt=\"load effective address\"></p>\n<p><strong>But Stan, Wait!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Can't we just do the same thing by writing <code class=\"language-text\">MOV ESI, EBX + 12 * EAX + 8</code>?</em></p>\n<p>Well no, we cannot. The explanation will become clear after reading a <em>riveting</em> discussion on Stackoverflow spanning 2011 - 2018 <a href=\"#references\">[4]</a>.</p>\n<p>To simply put it, here are the main points of why that is not possible:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-text\">MOV</code> instruction is not designed for just calculating the address of a given memory location. Its job is to <strong>access</strong> whatever value is stored at that address, meaning it actually takes extra time to <strong>read</strong> the contents of that memory location. <code class=\"language-text\">LEA</code> just does the math on the given values.</li>\n<li>It is not valid to perform some form of computation without some brackets or parenthesis.</li>\n<li>Assuming that there is a specialized function for <code class=\"language-text\">MOV</code> that did allow for the line of code above, it would make the syntax less clean. It is subjective, but it is much easier to distinguish loading from memory and calculating an address if you have 2 different instructions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are probably more reasons, but in general, having a dedicated instruction for calculating addresses is a lot cleaner and more optimized than overloading an existing instruction which increases complexity and decreases readability.</p>\n<h2 id=\"compare\">Compare</h2>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">cmp</code> instruction is actually the same as the <code class=\"language-text\">sub</code> instruction  except that instead of storing the result in the first argument, it will set a <strong>flag</strong> in the processor.\nThe instruction can be executed as <code class=\"language-text\">cmp arg1, arg2</code>.</p>\n<p>That <strong>flag</strong> will have these possible values:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">&lt; 0</code> - <code class=\"language-text\">arg1 &lt; arg2</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">0</code> - <code class=\"language-text\">arg1 == arg2</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">&gt; 0</code> - <code class=\"language-text\">arg1 &gt; arg2</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/images/x86/x86-cmp.PNG\" alt=\"compare\"></p>\n<p>The <strong>flag</strong> being stored is actually the value of <code class=\"language-text\">arg1 - arg2</code>.\nAs an example, this is how it would work:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">cmp <span class=\"token number\">1</span>, <span class=\"token number\">3</span></code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>This instruction would perform <code class=\"language-text\">1 - 3</code>, setting <code class=\"language-text\">-2</code> inside the flag which tells us that <code class=\"language-text\">arg1 &lt; arg2</code>.</li>\n<li>Keep in mind that this is not really a valid way since we cannot compare 2 immediates directly.</li>\n<li>The first argument is usually a register while the second one can either be an immediate or a register.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now there are many other examples of using the <code class=\"language-text\">cmp</code> instruction along with many other acceptable arguments, which can all be found here <a href=\"#references\">[5]</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump\">Jump</h2>\n<p>Typically when using the <code class=\"language-text\">cmp</code> instruction above, it is followed by a <code class=\"language-text\">jmp</code> or <strong>jump</strong> instruction. This instruction takes in a single argument for the jump address as its parameter.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">jmp addr</code></pre></div>\n<p>The jump will be taken based on the value of the <strong>flag</strong> in the processor. When a jump is taken, the <code class=\"language-text\">eip</code> register is set to that argument. Of course, there are many variants of the jump instruction that change the flow of the program based on the value of the <strong>flag</strong>. The <code class=\"language-text\">jmp</code> instruction shown above is the <strong>unconditional jump</strong>.</p>\n<p>Below is a non-exhaustive list of the different jump instructions that exist. These are mainly the common ones.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">je</code> (jump equal) - jumps if equal</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">jz</code> (jump zero) - jump if zero</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">jl</code> (jump less) - jump if less</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">jg</code> (jump greater) - jump if greater</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are plenty more that can be found <a href=\"http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/x86-jumps.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> <a href=\"#references\">[6]</a>.</p>\n<p>Below is an example program written in pseudocode on how it may work. Addresses are on the left and instructions are on the right, assume that the <code class=\"language-text\">eip</code> points to <code class=\"language-text\">addr3</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">addr1 instr1\naddr2 cmp <span class=\"token number\">1</span>, <span class=\"token number\">3</span>\naddr3 jl addr10\naddr4 instr4\n...   ...\naddr10 instr10</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>Looking at the example above, the jump would be taken to <code class=\"language-text\">addr10</code> since <code class=\"language-text\">1 &lt; 3</code> and we are using <code class=\"language-text\">jl</code>, meaning jump if the first argument is less than the second.</li>\n<li>If we used <code class=\"language-text\">jg</code>, the <code class=\"language-text\">eip</code> would move to <code class=\"language-text\">addr4</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now you may have noticed that I used the word <strong>flag</strong> a lot in the last two sections, but what the heck is it?</p>\n<p>The idea of the <strong>FLAGS</strong> register is to serve as a status register that contains the <strong>current state of the processor</strong>. This essentially means that this <code class=\"language-text\">16 bit</code> wide register holds a lot of information as to what is going on in the processor.</p>\n<p>If the entire state of the CPU is stored in a single register, how do we keep track of multiple independent states?</p>\n<p>The idea of using a single register is to save space. Luckily through <strong>bitmasking</strong>, we can specify a specific set of bit(s) to represent the state of a certain piece of information. In short, each flag or state information is mapped to a specific set of bits. Confusing right?</p>\n<p>For example, let's say if we are performing some addition and a carry value has been generated by the ALU, the <strong>carry flag</strong> or <code class=\"language-text\">CF</code> is set to <code class=\"language-text\">1</code> to let us know that this has happened. This <code class=\"language-text\">1</code> is just 1 of the bits in the 16-bit register representing the state. To get the value of <code class=\"language-text\">CF</code> specifically, we use a mask value of <code class=\"language-text\">0x0001</code>, meaning that the <strong>least significant bit</strong> corresponds to the carry flag.</p>\n<p>The most common flags that are seen are typically <code class=\"language-text\">CF</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">ZF</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">OF</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">PF</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">SF</code>. Since this is only a brief overview, you can see a much more detailed breakdown of the x86 flags <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAGS_register\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> <a href=\"#references\">[7]</a>.</p>\n<p>FLAGS register is not limited to just <code class=\"language-text\">16</code> bits, as some processors have 32-bit and 64-bit register sizes. The 32-bit variant is denoted as EFLAGS while the 64-bit variant is denoted as RFLAGS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"call\">Call</h2>\nPerhaps this is the most important instruction of them all. It is a simple instruction on the surface that takes in a single argument.\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">call <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>func_addr<span class=\"token operator\">></span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This is designed to \"call\" a function in a program or library. When you disassemble your C program, you will notice that calls made to standard C library functions like <code class=\"language-text\">printf</code> all point to some memory address.</p>\n<p>The way that <code class=\"language-text\">call</code> works is that it pushes the return address, or the current value of <code class=\"language-text\">eip</code>, onto the stack and jumps to the argument.</p>\n<p>In other words, this means that <code class=\"language-text\">call &lt;func_addr&gt;</code> is equivalent to:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">push eip\njmp func</code></pre></div>\n<p>What this does is create the <strong>stack frame</strong> which in essence places all the parameters, the return address, and the function itself in the right order on the <strong>stack</strong> so it can execute and return to the caller. Every single function that is called will have its own stack frame, where the base pointer <code class=\"language-text\">ebp</code> contains the start of the stack frame and the <code class=\"language-text\">esp</code> points to the top of the stack frame.</p>\n<p>To call a function with parameters, it would look something like this. This is what <code class=\"language-text\">foo(a, b, c)</code> would look like in x86:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">push c\npush b\npush a\ncall foo</code></pre></div>\n<p>Note that we always push in reverse order since a stack is <strong>LIFO</strong>. Recall that all the parameters are stored on the <strong>stack</strong>. To access them, we can write something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">pop <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">esp</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">; Return address</span>\npop <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">esp</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">; Parameter 'a'</span>\npop <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">esp</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">; Paramater 'b'</span>\npop <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">esp</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">; Parameter 'c'</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Realistically, we are missing the stack base-pointer register, which helps us keep track of where the start of the stack frame is located since handling functions without it can be quite messy.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">pop <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">ebp</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">16</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">; Parameter 'c'</span>\npop <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">ebp</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">; Parameter 'b'</span>\npop <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">ebp</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">; Parameter 'a'</span>\npop <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">ebp</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">; Return address</span>\npop <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">ebp</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">; Saved stack base-pointer register</span></code></pre></div>\n<h2 id=\"leave\">Leave/Ret</h2>\n<p>These two instructions are always used at the end of a given function. The <code class=\"language-text\">leave</code> instruction is always followed by the <code class=\"language-text\">return</code> instruction as seen in disassembling C programs.</p>\n<p>These two instructions make up what we know as today as a single <code class=\"language-text\">return</code> statement in higher level languages like Java or C. They must be used together as they <strong>clean up the stack frame</strong> and <strong>returns to the correct part of the program</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">leave\nret</code></pre></div>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">leave</code> instruction performs the clean up of the stack frame. It:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Shifts <code class=\"language-text\">esp</code> to where <code class=\"language-text\">ebp</code> is located, which is the base of the stack frame for the current function (callee).</li>\n<li>Pops from the top of the stack into <code class=\"language-text\">ebp</code>, which holds the address of the old stack frame (caller).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In x86, it is <code class=\"language-text\">leave</code> is equivalent to this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">movl <span class=\"token register variable\">ebp</span>, <span class=\"token register variable\">esp</span>\npopl <span class=\"token register variable\">ebp</span></code></pre></div>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/images/x86/x86-leave.PNG\" alt=\"leave\"></p>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">return</code> instruction takes the value at the top of the stack after <code class=\"language-text\">leave</code> is called, which is the return address to the caller, and pops it into <code class=\"language-text\">esp</code>. In the end, the program continues executing where it left off in the caller function.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/images/x86/x86-ret.PNG\" alt=\"return\"></p>\n<h2>It's time for me to leave and ret</h2>\n<p>Understanding x86 is crucial in understanding and developing future exploits of your own. I really hope this helped to make x86 seem a little less scary.</p>\n<p>There is, of course, a lot more to learn, but this should lay the groundwork for future research.

It's probably of some guy standing in his mansion holding an expo marker with illegible scribbles written on an Easel Pad with various arrows and dollar signs scattered throughout what supposedly is the next big thing. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CMaUfyPWIAAtQ-E.jpg\" alt=\"Straight out of his Garage\" title=\"Peep his garage\"></p>\n<p>At this point, you probably know the different entrepreneurs that I am referring to: Tai Lopez, Grant Cardone, and Alex Becker. This is no way meant to call them out on anything, but with the recent increase in the number of people who have joined them in promoting their marketing training programs, it seems that something that they are doing is correct. But of course, this could really just be an isolated incident where YouTube has been targeting me based on watch history, but I dispelled this notion after hearing about the same encounters from my friends.</p>\n<p>In short, the one thing that these three have in common is that they all offer some sort of training that will allow people to become successful in starting and boosting their online sales, whether if it is managing social media accounts for small businesses or using Shopify to sell trending items. All 3 of them preach the idea of <em>hustling</em> to work towards not only building a successful business but also a successful life.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/409/466/16a.png\" alt=\"Let&#x27;s get this bread\"></p>\n<p>After looking more into them, there seems to be a sizable portion that just hates their content -- calling them \"scams\" or that their wealth merely consists of a rented mansion, Lamborghinis, and private jets. The one thing that popped into my mind was how successful these guys are at getting publicity and there are certain things that I've noticed that make their ads so appealing. </p>\n<h3>The Hooks</h3>\n<p>Now there are several somewhat effective tactics that these guys love to use in order to draw in as many viewers as they can. As with all their ads, the first 5 seconds is crucial in order to get viewers engaged since most of them are long enough that they can be skipped. The old way that marketers usually would start their ad is to discourage the viewer from skipping, but this has gotten less and less as it was completely overused, clichÃ©, and ineffective. Instead, a more clever tactic is needed to hook viewers in: through results.</p>\n<p>I think we can all agree that people love to see results. They serve as great indicators for when something is going right or going wrong. When one sees others succeeding in some job, one can't help but wonder if they can accomplish just the same -- if not better. This, in essence, is exactly what these YouTube ads show. It could be Tai Lopez strolling down the street with one of his successful mentees in London talking about partnerships with \"major brands\" or Alex Becker scrolling down his Facebook page to show someone with $18k in sales in the last month with his Shopify store. Within the first 5 seconds, you are shown expensive cars and amazing sales figures to create an investment on your end to find out more about how they achieved them. A few minutes later, you realize you just <strong>sat through an entire YouTube ad</strong>.</p>\n<p>The second major theme that all three notably share is the somewhat low production value that their ads have. Keep in mind, all three of them have enough money to hire a professional camera crew with the best equipment around. However, the fact that they just use an iPhone, go unscripted and keep it as much as a conversation with you as possible. This allows them to connect with you not as a salesman, but as a regular person with no hidden motives. With a professional looking advertisement and expected punch lines of \"limited time only\" or \"join millions of others who became rich\",  many would be quick to label it as an annoying ad and quickly dismiss it. Grant Cardone realized this a while back and switched from his more formal video styles from 2010 to an off-script one which yielded a lot more views.</p>\n<p>The third major theme is the continuous action that takes place in the background. This is probably more notable in Tai's videos but they sometimes are used in Grant's videos as well. Tai typically starts recording after he has done something, whether if it is walking through his garage, after a jog, or even after his meetings. He continuously moves through whatever environment he is in -- which is a masterful technique in keeping the person's attention.</p>\n<h3>Can Goldfish Pay Attention?</h3>\n<p>As an aside, it is important to note that the pace of films today is much faster than when Alfred Hitchcock's <em>Psycho</em> first came out in 1960. According to Mike Feurstein writeup in <em>Filmmaker Magazine</em> [2], much of the content on the web today \"demands attention spans shorter than most goldfish\". This is evident in the rise (and fall) of video apps like Vine and Tiktok. Of course there are some exceptions where films do not follow the traditional pace of filming back then, but for the most part, much of these films featured many still shots of people, landscapes, etc. For example, Sergio Leone loved including long takes of the surrounding landscape <em>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</em> to evince the rugged landscape that the movie takes place in.</p>\n<p>This is in stark contrast with the fast-paced riffs of pop culture that exist today mainly on the web. Popular videos are often quite short, funny, and stimulating to keep viewers engaged overall --- and making them return for more [1].  Although the people I refer to don't make funny videos, they successfully apply the same principles that allow their content to be heavily shared, in addition to the promotional campaigns that they run.</p>\n<p>A brief search for some of Grant's older videos reveals the disparity between his older content and his new ones. In his newer videos, quite a few of them were able to surpass the 1 million view mark which had more camera movements, shaky hands, and more amateurish overall compared to his still and professional videos from almost a decade ago. This not to say that all of his videos surpass the 1 million mark easily. But for the ones that do, this is a common trait that they all share. Even though these videos do last longer than just a few minutes sometimes, the constant movement with things going on in the background acts as an illusion that stimulates the brain into paying more attention. This is an extremely powerful tactic in a medium where everyone is vying for your attention.</p>\n<h3>In Sum</h3>\n<p>For months, I've always found myself watching through to the end of some of their ads -- more than I'd like to admit. There are quite a few people who have also done an analysis on the way these guys market themselves and how effective it really is. These are some of the things that I think that they are doing correctly in terms of engaging even the most discerning of viewers. It is possible that I am giving them more credit than they actually deserve and all these different \"tactics\" are just a mere coincidence, but one cannot argue that this is a consistent pattern that is seen in a lot of their videos.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://nofilmschool.com/2012/11/attention-deficit-audiences-new-media-filmmaking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Attention-Deficit Audiences and How New Media Might Be Affecting Traditional Filmmaking</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://filmmakermagazine.com/58685-spanned-attentions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spanned Attentions</a></li>\n</ol>","id":"b3eed47c-aa2c-5009-9f1e-2a76dcbcc8ea","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2019-2-23-here-in-my-garage/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-02-23T11:34:17.948Z","path":"/here-in-my-garage","title":"here in my garage","description":null,"tags":["entrpreneurship","ads","videos","cinematography"]}}},"next":{"node":{"excerpt":"After making a substantial amount of edits for my last post which totaled 3 months of on and off work, I thought that it would be the perfect time to finally post it on Medium.

Medium has always been the one place where many go to read posts about various topics from self-improvement to economics and, the most important of all, software. The platform has manifested itself into a great source of knowledge filled with tutorials, discussions, and opinions from various developers in the industry. If I needed a tutorial on how to set up a microservice architecture deployed to docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes, Medium was bound to have a comprehensive guide on that.</p>\n<p>With such a large and growing community of developers, I thought that importing posts that contained links, images, and code snippets should be a synch given the widespread availability of Markdown. It is the primary markup language on most developer platforms and adoption seems to only be growing over time. Feeling confident that I am now finally done with editing, I simply created a <strong>gist</strong> with the contents of my post and clicked the <strong>import</strong> button. To my surprise, everything came out <strong>wrong</strong>.</p>\n<p>Looking through the post, it seemed that the importer worked correctly at the very beginning of the post. The title, table of contents, and first paragraph looked to be in order. Once it runs into some content written in HTML, things started to get a lot worse.  Links, images, and code snippets ended up disappearing altogether at some parts of the post. What's worse was that the importer was not able to pick up some bullets and numbered list correctly, where it either deleted some of the lines and renumbered them. A sinking feeling hit me as I realize that I had to go through editing the entire post again. This is especially gruesome on really long posts. Additional complications arise with Medium's custom formatting which is incompatible with existing Markdown posts.</p>\n<h3>The Issues</h3>\n<p>Although it may sound like I am just nitpicking here, there are quite a few limitations of the Medium editor that prevents it from reaching its fullest potential. The editor UX seems fine on the surface given the features that it offers, but one will quickly realize the number of <em>gotchas</em> that actually exist within the platform.</p>\n<p><strong>These are the few things that I feel really set Medium back as a platform for publishing:</strong></p>\n<h5>1: Nested Lists</h5>\n<p>When I first tried to convert my blog post, I thought most things would instantly be formatted correctly with only a few things needed to be adjusted here and there. One of the things I like to use to organize my content is to nest lists to create some sort of hierarchy in the information I'm presenting.</p>\n<p>All I got was a big fat <strong>nope</strong>.</p>\n<p>What ended up happening was that anything that contained a nested list was completely stripped out. Sure it can be mostly fixed by copying and pasting the information again, but there is absolutely no option in the editor to offer any means of indentation with the bullet points.</p>\n<p>I'm not the only one who feels that this is a major drawback in the editor itself. Just ask these users:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Medium?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Medium</a> How does one insert nested lists (OLs or ULs) in content? First level is simple. Second level?</p>&mdash; Robert Koritnik (@robertkoritnik) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robertkoritnik/status/520107363408572416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 9, 2014</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.canny.io/feature-requests/p/nested-lists\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nested List | Feature Request | Medium</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor/issues/666\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Create list inside of list</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Note that this is a discussion on a separate project.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The lack of response to writers who want these features shows you where Medium's priorities really are, which of course, is to paywall more articles.</p>\n<h5>2: Code Embedding</h5>\n<p>With many notable tech blogs hosting their content on Medium such as <strong>Treehouse</strong>, <strong>Basecamp</strong>, <strong>Slack</strong>, <strong>FreeCodeCamp</strong>, <strong>Netflix</strong>, and other publishers and independent writers, it would make sense for Medium to have its own way of embedding and displaying code to readers.</p>\n<p>In fact, Medium does; only if you are fine with settling for a plain un-highlighted gray-black block sitting in the middle of your page.</p>\n<p>This may seem like a small detail, but it makes sifting through large code snippets without going somewhat blind. I think it is great that Medium does support the <strong>triple backtick</strong> syntax of starting a code block since 2016, but that only scratches the surface of what code blocks can actually do.</p>\n<p>One solution that many developers and I use is to embed code snippets from other third party services like <strong>Gist</strong>, <strong>Codepen</strong>, and <strong>JSFiddle</strong>. This is <strong>much</strong> better than the existing editor implementation and better than adding images of your code since <strong>Medium does not support alternative text for visually impaired developers.</strong> [1].</p>\n<p>This seems fine, but if you have an existing blog post already written in Markdown, creating a new gist or code snippet on other services becomes a chore that doesn't need to exist in the first place. There are, however, tools like <a href=\"https://markdowntomedium.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this</a> one that creates the code blocks for you, but that ultimately ends up polluting your Gist. The point is, there shouldn't be this many steps in trying to publish blog posts that contain code snippets.</p>\n<h5>3: Images? What Images?</h5>\n<p>As expected, since Medium did not support Markdown, any form of embedding images was completely stripped out after I used the <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/import\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">import</a> tool, all the images got stripped out. <em>Wonderful.</em></p>\n<p>The one thing I can do about it is to upload the images one at a time, but this shouldn't even be necessary in the first place.</p>\n<p>This could easily be implemented in the editor if there was support for embedding images by only using the Markdown syntax.</p>\n<p>In addition, the support for captions for images is just simply missing, making it difficult for people who have trouble seeing.</p>\n<h5>4: Tables</h5>\n<p>This is very common in a lot of text editors already where we can easily organize our data in a series of rows and columns. It may require some more work for the Medium team to implement, but things such as embedding tables for data sets, spreadsheets, and calculations are quite important in the developer space.</p>\n<p>At least even in Wordpress, you have the option to embed tables via external plugins. The lack of this feature just makes it feel very limited.</p>\n<h5>5: Limitations in Post Design/Control</h5>\n<p>Now we cannot put Medium at fault for lacking these features. Medium is designed following the ethos of minimalism, but some of that is being stripped away with the addition of new modal dialogs and distractions floating around the article itself. These are a few things that are also quite limiting the platform as a whole:</p>\n<h6>Lack of Interactive Content</h6>\n<p>It is hard to embed visualizations powered by JS libraries like <a href=\"https://d3js.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">d3.js</a>. The best you can do on Medium is to just make these screenshots or link your readers to other sites to view your interactive content.</p>\n<p>This greatly limits how much information could actually be presented in Medium itself.</p>\n<h6>Custom HTML/CSS</h6>\n<p>Without being able to add custom HTML, crafting a beautiful blog post without making it look generic starts to become a challenge. The flexibility of styling the page the way you like can be made possible if Markdown was supported. In addition, custom styles would be a huge plus in allowing writers to have more variety in their posts. The one thing, however, is that the HTML must be sanitized before it can be rendered on pages to prevent XSS attacks.</p>\n<h6>Video Embeds</h6>\n<p>The only way to show videos is to link them through <em>YouTube</em> or <em>gfycat</em>. This is still debatable since these platforms do offer quite a bit of flexibility. However, they end up loading a lot of extra dependencies like JS libraries that add bandwidth and loading time. This does not make for a great mobile experience.</p>\n<h3>Benefits of Markdown</h3>\n<p>There is no question that Markdown has seen a dramatic increase in its adoption ever since its inception in 2004. It is widely adopted in many version control sites like <a href=\"https://github.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Github</a> and <a href=\"https://gitlab.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gitlab</a>, messaging platforms like <a href=\"https://slack.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Slack</a>, project management platforms like <a href=\"https://trello.com/en-US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trello</a>, static site generators like <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gatsby</a> and <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jekyll</a>, and even note-taking apps like <a href=\"https://typora.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Typora</a>. The list here is <strong>not exhaustive</strong>.</p>\n<p>Many have turned to Markdown in the recent years since it is syntactically simplistic compared to HTML, widely adopted by many tools on the web, and commonly used among marketers and tech teams. </p>\n<p>The barrier to entry, even for professionals who do not program, is substantially lower than any other markup language that exists today. And no, <em>formatting your text in Word does not count</em>. There are no extra words or letters like <code class=\"language-text\">href</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">a</code>, etc. that may be confusing and just irrelevant to a marketer in a sales agency trying to promote their product.</p>\n<p>The syntax to learn is quite small, making the output quite predictable most of the time and a lot less <strong>error prone</strong>. There is no need to fiddle around with styling your elements or trying to make sure that elements are presented correctly. Although some may view this as a downside for Markdown due to its fixed design nature, it is extremely efficient if anyone wanted to create a quick, nicely formatted document to serve as documentation for an application or just taking some quick notes. Its low verbosity means that you can spend less time typing boilerplate and more time on the actual content.</p>\n<p>To appease the technical folk, Markdown allows inline HTML to provide more flexibility in creating different layouts. If there is something that cannot be done in Markdown, you can still write HTML and your parser will understand.</p>\n<p>Like HTML, Markdown documents can be previewed instantly without having to install any other library (<em>cough</em> looking at you <strong>MiKTeX</strong> <em>cough</em>) or running any specific commands. There are a plethora of online editors for both markup languages that would present the content just fine.</p>\n<h3>Solutions?</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gee Stan, Markdown sure sounds great but there's a problem. How can I easily convert my Markdown posts to Medium?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You see, this has been a big problem that many have solved, or attempted to solve I should say.</p>\n<p>In short, there is no <em>one size fits all</em> converter that could accurately convert all Markdown files into Medium's format without losing a few elements here and there. Below are a couple of ways and tools that other bloggers have taken to bridge the gap.</p>\n<h5>Markdown To Medium</h5>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://markdowntomedium.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tool</a> is perhaps the one that comes closest to preserving all the formatting that you have in your posts. Not only does it automatically import your content, but it also <strong>automatically creates gist</strong> for all of your code snippets to add proper syntax highlighting. This may clutter up your gist collection, but it is a small price to pay for making publishing a blog post so much easier.</p>\n<h5>Medium Editor Markdown</h5>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://ionicabizau.github.io/medium-editor-markdown/example/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">extension</a> to <a href=\"https://yabwe.github.io/medium-editor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Medium Editor</a> adds Markdown and HTML editing to render content as seen in Medium. This is great if you want a quick preview on how your post may look by simply pasting your existing Markdown file.</p>\n<h4>Create Your Own Blog</h4>\n<p>It may be a drastic choice, but nonetheless viable. It's a great way to step into the world of static site generators like Gatsby, Hugo, and Jekyll. You will end up getting all the control in terms of how to style your blog, how to code it, and how to deploy it. Earlier this year (2019), <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/we-just-launched-developer-news-heres-how-you-can-use-it/279929\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FreeCodeCamp</a> made the jump in their announcement albeit for other reasons. Nevertheless, they are not the only blog that is moving off of Medium.</p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-add-code-to-medium-and-get-syntax-highlighting-d699761a5883/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to display code blocks in Medium</a></li>\n</ol>","id":"9ba560fe-1757-52e0-bb98-18907beb7e4f","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2019-7-4-why-medium-needs-markdown/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-07-04T02:45:23.757Z","path":"/why-medium-needs-markdown","title":"why medium needs markdown","description":"The time for Markdown support on Medium is now.","tags":["medium","blogging","markdown","post"]}}}}}
