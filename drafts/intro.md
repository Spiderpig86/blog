# intro

**TODO: Remove title**

*Some brief intro*

*So, here we go.* After months of delaying this blog, I finally decided to put on my big boy pants to actually get started. Even though this is the last of break at the time I'm writing this, I still consider it a personal win that I even remembered.

And this is what this blog is going to be about; a list of personal wins, losses, and my various views on tech and whether if french fries really does go with soft serve \**cough*\* you guys know who you are \**cough*\*.

### The Tech

Now having no prior experience with maintaining a blog of any sort, I had literally no idea how the hell I should get started. Naturally, I ended up going through a few iterations before I ended up with this.

#### v1: The Static Site

This is as basic as it gets. In a nutshell, this involves having a one-page layout where new posts were updated manually. The rest of the functionality like filtering posts would just be powered by basic JavaScript or even jQuery.

Why this sucked:

* Posts would have to be written in HTML (nasty)
* Development would be way more tedious
* **Not futureproof**

#### v2: Gatsby + React

Now, the other options I considered were using Wordpress and Hexo (a blog framework for Node.js). Both are great and all, but Wordpress seemed to be a bit too limited in terms of the level of control I have over this and Hexo albeit seemed to fit perfectly for this project, it really was limited to just making blogs without any purpose beyond that.

Then comes Gatsby -- the static site generator, not the one who got shot :cry:. 

#### Limitations

As of now, much of the blog is done in terms of features. However, there is still that annoying issue where links won't actually take you to the correct section of the blog.
