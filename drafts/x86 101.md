# x86 101

## Why?

You might be wondering why I would subject myself to torture by trying to learn Assembly in the first place since it's "either too hard" or  "it's boring as hell". Well you're right, it's definitely not the most interesting thing in the world. Since I'm taking a course of offensive security, I *kinda* need to at least understand the basics of it.

So far, there aren't too many simple guides on learning x86 online compared to other languages. So hopefully, this will be a quick and easy guide for you to follow  to learn the very basics of x86. :smile:
