# Staying Sane as a SWE

Being a full time software engineer, like many other jobs, is no easy task. Days are spent sitting, pondering, and wondering why running the same code would not yield different results. Sometimes the solutions are quite obvious and can be solved with just a half hour of Googling. But in most cases, they are not. It is not uncommon to see developers stuck on an esoteric issue where the only discussion online is an unanswered question from 2013 by a user named "Uwu52".

Now that I've graduated, I know first hand of how arduous projects can be and how keeping an unhealthy schedule can wreak havoc on anyone's health. If you're like me, college projects could mean all-nighters, frustrating schedules, and constant iteration due to the fickle nature of some professors. However, there were times I ended up not even eating a proper meal (Soylent does not count), missing out on time with friends and family, and skipping my workouts. As a result, I was exhausted around deadlines and even started to lose interest in the idea of being a software engineer for a little while.

*But wait, Stan, can't you avoid all this by starting early and having proper time management?*

In an ideal world, we can all solve our problems right away by doing what we say. Unfortunately, shit happens â€” you missed a bug, you forgot a minor feature, the project spec changes last minute, your database goes down, and so on. The point is, even if you have written unit and end to end tests, sharded and replicated your databases, and deployed your service to many availability zones across the world, something may probably go wrong. A good adage for this field is:

> Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.

Murphy's law .
