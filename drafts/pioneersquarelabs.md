# A Meetup at PSL

It's July. You've done a lot of the touristy and fun things where you are now sitting on your bed, scrolling through the Amazon slack to find stuff to do.

You stop at "Entrepreneurial Intern Event @ Pioneer Square Labs" and think, *this is something new*. And in bold, **food and drinks provided**.

*Hmm...*

You know I'm always down for anything that is remotely associated with any free food and drink. With nothing else scheduled, this doesn't seem too bad of an event to attend. It would probably just consist of a bunch of VCs and "CEOs" to brag about their successes and poach aspiring developers. The very fact that this is an intern and invite-only event makes it seem that it was only organized in order to siphon talent from Microsoft, Amazon, etc…

Looking into Reddit for what these events are like, I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/5k57y1/rant_i_am_so_tired_of_going_to_entrepreneur/), [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/6szd8b/do_real_entrepreneurs_actually_attend_meetups_for/), and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/9uexow/advice_reddit_please/). It seems that these redditors have a far from favorable view of these entrepreneurial meetups in general, one commenting "My god, this is the largest group of self-delusional 'wantrepreneurs' I have ever met".

Not wanting to be the only one "networking", I got another intern on my team to tag along.

Until now, my knowledge on startups and entrepreneurship really just comprises of a hodgepodge of Gary Veynerchuk videos on YouTube, Silicon Valley, and this [handy library](https://github.com/words/buzzwords) of all the obnoxious buzzwords that HR loves to throw around to woo in potential candidates on LinkedIn. In short, not very extensive. 

## The Meetup

Pioneer Square in Seattle is known to be the founding location of Seattle, hence the word "Pioneer". But over the years, the area has vastly transformed which now features shopping carts filled with trash bags, worn down tents, and your local guy tripping out of his mind.

In the midst of all this lies a startup studio, [Pioneer Square Labs](https://www.psl.com/). After walking in, an employee quickly escorted us to the third floor where other interns were mingling and drinking copious amounts of  *La Croix™*. The elevator doors opened to an open office featuring a rugged design mixed with Cedar wood running from the floor to the roof and string lights that came straight out of a college dorm featured on Instagram.

"The meetup is to my left", said one employee and scooted us to the thing we came for, the pizza.

Once we were satiated with the amount of pizza and drinks we got, the presentation finally began with an "Omaha" (forgive me since memory seems to fail me while writing this) which is a tradition they have in encouraging someone to give a speech. In simple terms, it's just cheering exceptionally loud from a much smaller crowd. Cute.

The very first to speak was a co-founder of the incubator, [Greg Gottesman](https://www.psl.com/team/greg-gottesman), who is also an adjunct professor in the University of Washington teaching entrepreneurship. Having found several successful companies in the past in addition to being a professor, I have no questions about his credibility.

Up until now, I was only interested in killing some time and getting free food. However, it was at this point where I started to truly listen.

Soon after, the CEOs of several startups spoke. What I had initially expected was an entire hour of speakers going up and boasting about their successes and throw around a bunch of fancy buzzwords that would attract young developers like myself. However, I could not have been more wrong.

The main takeaway from these speakers was that nothing in life was set in stone. The founder of Glow, a platform designed to simplify podcast subscriptions, spoke about her transition from working in the US government to solve a fundamental problem in something she loved. The founder of SingleFile, a company aimed to make state and local regulations compliance much easier for starting companies, went from studying law to doing tech. As cheesy and cliche of a saying it is, the future is always full of uncertainties.

The second part was more of a discussion with two current employees in PSL — one handling business operations and the other the principle data scientist. One major part of their discussion was about the process on how they vet prospective partnerships with other founders. The one thing that stuck out to me was how much data analysis was involved even in the initial stages of launching something new in order to prove if something was viable or not.

A quick rundown of what this process looks like is:

1. An initial trial run is created which consisted of many variations of the given idea marketing wise. This means different variations of landing pages, designs, and marketing campaigns across Facebook and Google ads.
2. After some period of time, the **CTR** (click-through rate) is assessed and a decision is made for continuing the idea. Most ideas that don't do well tend to end here.
3. Additional optimizations are made and designs/ideas begin to become a lot more polished.
4. Teams start to form where people of PSL meet with the client.
5. At this point, the stages start to blur a bit as you meet with different partners (VCs) and begin assembling your team to help build your company.

I can guarantee you that the process is a lot more complicated than what I have stated above.

There were definitely some great examples of ideas that didn't work, such as a radiation detector made from RAM chips that consisted of softened
