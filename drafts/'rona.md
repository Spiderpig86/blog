I have been meaning to write this post for a while after deep diving into all the events that have unfolded ever since the virus began its exodus from China. Now as a full disclaimer, everything I express below is my personal view. I will not apologize for it.

The whole situation is quite complicated and I wanted to address a few things that I think that led things to become the way they are now. 

There is no question that the US-China antagonism will define this current admiration evinced by the on-going trade war and Trump's rhetoric during white house press briefings. Equally, one can argue that President Xi's office is just as laser focused on the US. The actions taken by each nation are greatly influenced by their political ideologies -- one that enables strict measures with harsh punishments and one that is more lenient and forgiving. A telling example is how  lockdown was strictly enforced with arrests, barricaded apartment doors, and lines of people at the hospital in China while some downplayed its severity as it wasn't an imminent threat.

Unfortunately, it became one. With Italy being dealt the worst blow from the virus in mid-March, cases started doubling in the US with the hardest hit region now being New York. What followed was a series of finger pointing and mistrust. misinformation and government propaganda, and acts of racism against the Asian American communities.

The events that directly/indirectly transpired from this virus as much virological as it is geopolitical.

### History

In 2003, a wet market in Foshan, Guangdong was believed to be the original location of the SARS outbreak. This wet market was known not just for selling your standard fare of groceries, but also for selling exotic animals such as civets, foxes, peacocks, and rats just to name a few. This prompted a sweeping ban on the sale of exotic animals by the Chinese government only to be lifted a year later in 2004 [1]. In 2007, a joint China-Hong Kong research team soon proved civets were be the direct cause of the SARS outbreak of 2003 from animal to human transmission [2].

To understand why the ban was lifted in the first place, we need to understand the large amount of lobbying power that the wild-life trading businesses have within the Chinese Communist Party. A more detailed explanation from Vox can be found [here](https://youtu.be/TPpoJGYlW54?t=260). Despite being a small portion of China's economic output, wildlife farming became a common way for small farmers to sustain themselves after China relinquished control of all food production. Over the last few decades, many of these farmers have become major players in farming exotic animals and continued to sell more and more of them at these wet markets.

Fast forward to now, history is simply repeating itself except with a new location and a new animal.

### Chinese Response

Starting late mid-December, I have already seen some news circulating around a new virus originating in Wuhan. There was one [video](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvBOnmehhiE>) in particular (now made unavailable for some reason). The main points of the video included how scientists have approached the Chinese government twice regarding an unknown strain of pathogen that was found in a deceased man's body with dates going as far back as November 26th, 2019. Now, I do question the contents of the video since they didn't seem substantiated with much evidence but it did raise an alarm of how severe the virus could become. 

In early January, Dr. Li Wenliang along with others was taken in by local authorities after he warned his WeChat group chat of researchers on December 30th, 2019 regarding an unknown virus that has been popping up within hospitalized patients. Despite warning his colleagues not to spread the information, the screenshot was found circulating Chinese social media that night. Local authorities saw the rumored photo and took him into custody. He was forced to sign a [document ](<https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-182d149dc43b39a8eaff6ea8cc5550b7>) promising that he would no longer discuss information that would harm the social order of the country.

While treating a patient with viral pneumonia, Li started experiencing a worsening cough and fever in mid-January. He passed away on February 7th. 2020. His death sparked widespread criticism and condemnation of the government on Weibo [for not responding quickly enough](<https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-doctor-who-issued-early-warning-on-virus-dies-11581019816?mod=hp_lead_pos7&mod=article_inline&mod=article_inline>) which alarmed party officials.

### Information Control/Online Response

With growing dissent online, officials feared that this would result in a large disruption of social order and calls for a more transparent government. The government's response was to call for [mass censorship](<https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/07/coronavirus-chinese-rage-death-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang>) by removing any cries for freedom of speech, memorialization of the Dr. Li as an anti-establishment figure, and those who call for change. According to the  National Supervisory Commission, "Li Wenliang was a Communist Party member, not a so-called antiestablishment figure". To me, this statement was used to bolster the party's stance of being the "good guy" in this situation.

Even any mention of the "American CDC" or "coronavirus" from outside China [were removed before being sent to any Chinese WeChat account](<https://thenextweb.com/tech/2020/03/04/surprise-wechat-is-censoring-messages-about-coronavirus-in-china/>) as per orders from the government. My personal experience with WeChat also confirms that messages are just not received if it contained information they don't deem fitting.

It's almost been two months since his death and discussions such as [this](<https://www.zhihu.com/question/384608861>) continue to this day on social media platforms like 知乎, a platform that is similar to Quora. In the post above, users discussed if the country's decision to name the 14 frontline victims in Hubei, including Dr. Li, a martyr is correct. The overall response was very much in support of his inclusion in the list. According to Chinese law, those who distort, deny, and vilify the deeds of martyr are subject to punishment by Chinese law. But what seemed pretty funny not too long in the past were people online accusing him of trying to disrupt social order by spreading rumors of the virus. They now find themselves supporting the doctor themselves.

To me, this is very similar to how the average person reacts to Gordon Ramsay reviewing food on Hell's Kitchen and it goes a little something like this:

> Me: Oh man that looks so good.
>
> Ramsay: Absolutely dreadful.
>
> Me: Absolutely dreadful.

Many on Chinese social media called for the punishment of local officials for covering up in the first place.
