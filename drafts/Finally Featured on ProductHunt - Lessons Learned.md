# Finally Featured on ProductHunt - Lessons Learned ðŸš€

November 3rd, arguable the most important date in US history -- well only every 4 years. But this year, it is especially important. This year, the people metaphorically went out in droves to vote for their beliefs, for their families, and for their future. And the results have definitely shown.

ðŸŽ‰ This year is finally the year that [Cirrus](https://github.com/Spiderpig86/Cirrus) is featured on [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/). ðŸŽ‰

Although I may not have made it to the top 5 products of the day, I was still able to be featured on the first page on 11/3 as the 9th rank garnering 228 upvotes (at the time that I am writing this). In all honesty, I did not expect much going into this launch given the previous duds. But having gone through multiple past launches, I think I am finally comfortable enough to share what worked and what did not work (albeit only having one data point for a positive launch).

## What is ProductHunt?

Taken straight from the website:

> Product Hunt surfaces the best new products, every day. It's a place for product-loving enthusiasts to share and geek out about the latest mobile apps, websites, hardware projects, and tech creations.

In short, it's just a place where aspirational founders and developers go to pitch/launch their product/service. Pretty much anyone can post a product there, but only the best ones get featured each day in terms of popularity (usually the more upvotes you get, the higher you a ranked. However, that is not always the case). You can quite a big boost if you know anyone with a significant following on the platform to *hunt* or list your product. Unfortunately, I do not have such luxuries. But this does not mean that it is impossible to get something off the ground yourself if you play your cards right.

TODO: now talk about all the projects and attempts

I first created my account back in July of 2015 hoping to test the platform out to help grow my web browser, [Polarity](https://polaritybrowser.netlify.app/). At the time, Polarity started to receive more notable recognition from various websites and platforms as a viable alternative to existing browsers out there. I saw ProductHunt as a great means to help sustain that growth well into 2016 and 2017 since the platform was growing rapidly with more and more users, developers, and founders checking it out each day. I had already launched on Betalist and created multiple campaigns on Headtalker that provided a decent amount of reach, so I hoped to get some success launching here as well.

To launch, I took the best promotional images I had already created, wrote a comment outlining what the browser is, where it's featured, and what separates it from the rest, and launched it. At the end of the week, I had only amassed 7 upvotes and not even a single person asking questions about my project. At this point, it was not the end of the world, but I knew I needed to put more effort into my launches in order to capture people's attentions. My main focus was now to get one of my projects featured on ProductHunt, no matter how big or small.

Over the next few years, I've went on to launch a couple more projects on ProductHunt: [Nimbus](https://github.com/Spiderpig86/Nimbus), [Cirrus](https://github.com/Spiderpig86/Cirrus), and [SeaToGo](https://github.com/Spiderpig86/to-go). Like my first launch, all of these have failed to get featured. But for these projects, I have researched ways to improve the listing, time my launch correctly, and make the overall product more appealing with better images, descriptions, and fixing up the project itself. I wondered why nothing seemed to work after spending hours trawling through posts after post of how others were able to successfully launch their projects. Some talked about how launching on specific days of the week increased your chances of getting featured, but I honestly could not find any success in that.

After working on a brand spanking new version of Cirrus, I decided to try again. On November 2nd, 2020, I launched Cirrus at midnight and went straight to bed.

## Results

I wasn't too hopeful that this launch was any different than the last. I went onto the dashboard not really expecting any huge surprise, but I was wrong -- and I was damn sure happy to be wrong. Cirrus slotted in at the 11th ranked featured product for that day with ~50 upvotes. This may not be significant, but just being featured had already exceeded all my expectations. By the end of the day, Cirrus had overtaken the next to products to be the 9th rank featured product. In the first two days of the launch, Cirrus was visited by over 2,500 unique visitors. On Github, Cirrus gained almost 200 stars with over 2,000 visitors to the repository. NPM downloads and JSDelivr hits have also increased.

The best case scenario would be if your launch becomes one of the top 5 products for that day since ProductHunt would blast your product to 500k subscribed users via email. Getting 9th gives me hope in knowing I am heading in the right direction for future launches.
