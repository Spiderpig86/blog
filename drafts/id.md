"Give me one minute of your time..."

If you've ever been on Youtube, chances are that you have seen some "affluencers" try to pitch you their get rich quick scheme in the first 5 seconds before you skip the ad. It's probably of some guy standing in his mansion holding an expo marker with illegiable scribbles written on an Easel Pad with various arrows and dollar signs scattered throughout what supposedly is the *next big thing*. The other strategy they have is to show you sales figures on one of their mentee's Shopify accounts which boasts some really impressive results.

But of course, this could really just be an isolated incident where Youtube has been targeting me based on watch history, but I dispeled this notion after hearing about the same encounters from my friends.

In short, the one thing that these three have in common is that they all offer some sort of training that will allow people to become successful in starting and boosting their online sales, whether if it is managing social media accounts for small businesses or using Shopify to sell trending items. All 3 of them preach the idea of **hustling** to work towards not only building a successful business, but also a successful life.

After looking more into them, there seems to be a sizable portion that just hate their content -- calling them "scams" or that their wealth merely consists of a rented mansion, Lamborghinis, and private jets.

Of course, there are stories of those who have purchased programs and were ghosted when a refunded was requested [CITATION] or complaints from those who feel that there were no positive results stemming from months of mentorship. It's hard to label them as
