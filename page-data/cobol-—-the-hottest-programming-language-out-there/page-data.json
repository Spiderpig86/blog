Introducing COBOL, the language that makes C look like child's play.</p>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p>COBOL, or <strong>Co</strong>mmon <strong>B</strong>usiness-<strong>O</strong>riented <strong>L</strong>anguage, is a highly-verbose compiled language designed to run on mainframes powered by operating systems like z/OS from IBM. Designed in 1959, it was heavily inspired by the FLOW-MATIC language designed by Grace Hopper which features the same imperative and verbose syntax. The sole purpose of the language is to handle massive amounts of throughput in industries including airline ticketing, insurance claims, banking, and unemployment claims.</p>\n<p>So you might be wondering, why are we relying on such an old language to process business-critical transactions that affect millions of people? It is certainly not popular as indicated by its low ranking in the <a href=\"https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TIOBE Index</a> and with the advent of new/established languages such as Java, Python, and Go, new programmers have little reason to explore the world of COBOL.</p>\n<p>The interest to upgrade and change is there, but businesses that rely on COBOL are stuck between a rock and a hard place. First, the cost of replacing all of the existing infrastructure and code base with a newer language can be very time consuming and costly. In 2012, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia took on this <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-cobol/banks-scramble-to-fix-old-systems-as-it-cowboys-ride-into-sunset-idUSKBN17C0D8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">herculian task to transition its systems from COBOL to SAP ABAP</a>. In total, the update took 5 whole years, 1 billion Australian dollars (USD 749 million), and the assistance of 2 other companies (Accenture and SAP). Upgrading isn't impossible, it's just extremely costly.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/USA-BANKS-COBOL/010040KH18J/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reuters</a>, it seems that COBOL won't be going anywhere anytime soon. Also with the lack of COBOL developers to help with the migration, it looks like these systems would be here to stay for years to come. With the Coronavirus outbreak, the lack is more apparent than ever as unemployment processing systems in New Jersey were failing under the spike in unemployment claims. It's not that the system was failing its job, but the changing environment has made it inadequate.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We have systems that are 40-plus years old. There’ll be lots of postmortems, and one of them will be <em>how the heck did we get here?,</em> when we literally needed COBOL programmers.\" - Gov. Murphy of New Jersey</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When I first heard him say this on the news, I thought it was a joke. I initially thought that a majority of our systems would've at least been upgraded to something newer, but I guess I was just uninformed.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Unexpected <a href=\"https://t.co/A00tViNxJt\">pic.twitter.com/A00tViNxJt</a></p>&mdash; michael_nielsen (@michael_nielsen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1246577382347034625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 4, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>If COBOL is trending on Twitter, then you know it's serious.</p>\n<h2>Hello COBOL</h2>\n<p>Now that I've got you on board, time to teach you to become a full-fledge COBOL developer. So now, we will start with the most important step to becoming a COBOL developer, writing \"hello world\".</p>\n<p>But before that, we need to do a couple of things to get it up and running on your machine. For this guide, I will be using Ubuntu. This should work the same on the Windows WSL with Ubuntu.</p>\n<p>First, we need to install a COBOL compiler. For this, we will be installing <code class=\"language-text\">open-cobol</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">sudo</span> <span class=\"token function\">apt-get</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span> open-cobol</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now, we can begin writing our program. If you were to ask me what the program structure looks like, it is a cross of MIPS Assembly and FORTRAN. </p>\n<p>We start with different sections of the program. The <code class=\"language-text\">IDENTIFICATION DIVISION</code> is used to store program properties and the <code class=\"language-text\">PROCEDURE DIVISION</code> stores the functionality. Inside the <code class=\"language-text\">PROCEDURE DIVISION</code>, we will use the <code class=\"language-text\">DISPLAY</code> command to directly write to the screen. To end the program, we add the <code class=\"language-text\">STOP RUN</code> command at the end, much like adding <code class=\"language-text\">li $v0, 10</code> in MIPS.</p>\n<p>Open a new file in any editor and call it <code class=\"language-text\">hello.cob</code>. <code class=\"language-text\">*.cob</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">*.cbl</code> are file extensions for Cobol source files.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"cobol\"><pre class=\"language-cobol\"><code class=\"language-cobol\">000000*&gt; My first COBOL program.\n000100 IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.\n000200*&gt; Identifies the name of the program\n000300 PROGRAM-ID. HELLO_WORLD.\n      \n      *&gt; Instructions go here\n      PROCEDURE DIVISION.\n        DISPLAY &#39;Hello from COBOL :)&#39;.\n        STOP RUN.</code></pre></div>\n<p>You may have noticed a couple of things about the code itself. The first 6 digits are reserved for line numbers that increment <code class=\"language-text\">100</code> per line. Comments are defined with <code class=\"language-text\">*&gt;</code>. Each program statement ends with a period, much like the English.</p>\n<p>To compile this program, simply use <code class=\"language-text\">cobc</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">cobc -x hello.cob</code></pre></div>\n<p>The compiler should generate an executable file that you can simply execute with:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">./hello</code></pre></div>\n<p>And there you have it, your first Cobol program!</p>\n<h2>Aspects of the Language</h2>\n<p>This will be a quick overview of different aspects of the programming language. If you're interested, I recommend taking a look at the references I used to understand the language. Surprisingly, the documentation isn't too bad.</p>\n<h3>Program Structure</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Each line of the source file is offset 6 spaces to the right to account for the line numbers.</li>\n<li>Programs have different sections labeled with the <code class=\"language-text\">DIVISION</code> keyword to separate the responsibilities of each part of the program.</li>\n<li>\n<p>The first division is the <code class=\"language-text\">IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.</code> which stores the metadata that describes the program (<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_ibm_i_73/rzasb/iddiv.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">docs</a>).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-text\">PROGRAM-ID</code> paragraph allows you to specify the name of the program (<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_ibm_i_73/rzasb/progid.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">docs</a>).</li>\n<li>There can be other paragraphs, but those are optional.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The second division is the <code class=\"language-text\">ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.</code>, which is an optional section where you can define program configuration and inputs/outputs (<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_ibm_i_73/rzasb/envcfg.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">docs</a>).</li>\n<li>\n<p>The third section is the <code class=\"language-text\">DATA DIVISION.</code> that specifies the internal and external data the program will work with.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The variables must be specified in the <code class=\"language-text\">WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Last but not least, the <code class=\"language-text\">PROCEDURE DIVISION.</code> is essentially the <code class=\"language-text\">main()</code> function of our program. All of our wonderful spaghetti code goes here.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"cobol\"><pre class=\"language-cobol\"><code class=\"language-cobol\">      IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.\n        PROGRAM-ID. MY-PROGRAM.\n      \n      DATA DIVISION.\n        WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.\n        *&gt; Variables go here.\n      \n      PROCEDURE DIVISION.\n        *&gt; Functionality goes here.</code></pre></div>\n<h3>Variables</h3>\n<p>Variables are pretty unique in COBOL. Instead of defining a type, it seems you specify what the variables hold as a composite of different types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A - alphabetic</li>\n<li>X - alphanumeric</li>\n<li>V - decimal</li>\n<li>S - sign</li>\n<li>9 - numeric</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, a floating-point number with 3 digits and 2 digits of precision would look something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"cobol\"><pre class=\"language-cobol\"><code class=\"language-cobol\">        01 MY-FLOAT PIC S9(3)V9(2). VALUE +987.65.</code></pre></div>\n<p>Note that a value does not need to be specified for the variable. The best way I can sum up variable declaration is that we use the different symbols to represent the structure of the value that will be stored, much like how regex can be used to match different words/expressions.</p>\n<p>The numbers appearing on the left-hand side specify the level of the variable for nesting data just like how classes/struct can be used to wrap around other variables.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"cobol\"><pre class=\"language-cobol\"><code class=\"language-cobol\">      01 PERSON-ADDRESS.\n        05 HOUSE-NUMBER PIC 9(4).\n        05 STREET PIC X(24).\n        05 CITY PIC X(24).\n        05 COUNTRY PIC X(24) VALUE &#39;BELGIUM&#39;.</code></pre></div>\n<p>This is a very brief overview of variables, but I highly recommend looking at <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSUFAU_2.0.0/com.ibm.debugtool.doc/rmdita/rcmddco.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">documentation from IBM</a> to learn more.</p>\n<h3>Conditionals</h3>\n<p>Conditionals are quite self-explanatory given how it reads like plain English barring a couple of symbols.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"cobol\"><pre class=\"language-cobol\"><code class=\"language-cobol\">      PROCEDURE DIVISION.\n        *&gt; Initialize variables with numbers\n        MOVE 30 TO A.\n        MOVE 20 TO B.\n        MOVE 30 TO C.\n        \n        IF A &gt; B THEN\n            DISPLAY &#39;A &gt; B&#39;\n            IF A = C THEN\n                DISPLAY &#39;A = C&#39;\n            ELSE\n                DISPLAY &#39;A != C&#39;\n            END IF.\n        ELSE\n            DISPLAY &#39;A &lt;= B&#39;\n        END IF.</code></pre></div>\n<p>For switch statements, we specify the value to <code class=\"language-text\">switch</code> on (statement in Java) to be <code class=\"language-text\">True</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"cobol\"><pre class=\"language-cobol\"><code class=\"language-cobol\">      EVALUATE TRUE\n        WHEN A &lt; 20\n            DISPLAY &#39;A IS LESS THAN 20&#39;\n        WHEN A &lt; 30\n            DISPLAY &#39;A IS LESS THAN 30&#39;\n        WHEN A &lt; 40\n            DISPLAY &#39;A IS LESS THAN 40&#39;\n      END-EVALUATE.</code></pre></div>\n<p>Conditionals can also be combined with <code class=\"language-text\">NOT</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">AND</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">OR</code>, and some others.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"cobol\"><pre class=\"language-cobol\"><code class=\"language-cobol\">          IF A IS LESS THAN B AND A IS LESS THAN 50 THEN\n        DISPLAY &#39;THIS IS IN FACT TRUE&#39;\n      ELSE\n        DISPLAY &#39;THIS SHOULD NOT SHOW&#39;\n      END-IF.\n      \n      *&gt; Combined conditional without else\n      IF A IS POSITIVE OR A IS NEGATIVE THEN\n        DISPLAY &#39;A IS POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE&#39;.</code></pre></div>\n<p>For further reference, there is a lot written about <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSUFAU_1.0.0/com.ibm.debugtool.doc/rmdita/rcmdico.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how to implement conditionals</a>.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of other aspects of the language not shown here such as commands, strings, loops, file I/O, etc. </p>\n<h3>Now for the important question.</h3>\n<p><strong>Can COBOL be used for Leetcode?</strong> Absolutely. Allow me to demonstrate.</p>\n<p>For today's problem, we will be doing <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Leetcode 326</a>. <em>Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of three.</em> And for the follow-up, <em>could you do it without using any loop / recursion?</em></p>\n<p>For the solution below, we will accomplish both. The first solution that comes to keep dividing the given number, <code class=\"language-text\">n</code>, by 3 and see if the remainder is 0 at the end. However, that did not fit in with the follow-up and I got too tired to figure out how to write a loop, so we will use the change of base formula instead.</p>\n<p>i = log<sub>b</sub>(n)/log<sub>b</sub>(3)</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"cobol\"><pre class=\"language-cobol\"><code class=\"language-cobol\">      IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.\n           PROGRAM-ID.

First, I graduated. Second, I moved to the emerald city. Third, I started my job at AWS. </p>\n<p>And side note, <a href=\"https://polaritybrowser.netlify.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Polarity 10</a> is out. Y'all better check it out 💎.</p>\n<h3>moving.</h3>\n<p>To say this wasn't a big adjustment would just be a straight lie. Despite having lived here prior for ~3 months, picking up my entire life from one place to the next is much easier said than done. There was a lot of planning involved in what to purchase and coordinating with the building manager on how to handle items being shipped there before I arrived. Having landed in Seattle before 💩 hit the fan, I was spared the excess crowds and lack of necessities at Costco.</p>\n<p>Everything had to be either delivered or transported using Lyft, which meant that cost was sky-high.  Seriously, I don't think I've spent more time and money in a month than the two months I spent physically moving and buying all the things I needed. Luckily, I was able to explore much of Seattle's food scene while I waited for the rest of my kitchen supplies to get shipped. Streets were filled despite the cold and at this time, the panic didn't hit anyone. Things were looking pretty good.</p>\n<h3>beer virus.</h3>\n<p>Things were looking less good by early March. Infections were picking up in the Seattle area without any sign of slowing down. Businesses started to close, some employees were told to work from home if they presented symptoms, and some woke up to find that they lost their jobs. Test kits were scarce but the panic still hasn't set in. Stores were still stocked with goods, restaurants were still open, and I went to a party. Maybe you'll see a couple of people here and there wearing masks, but that's about it. Pretty much everyone was either unable to get one or <strong>kept perpetuating the idea that they are largely ineffective</strong>. Over the next few days, the traffic on the I-5 became sparse and the office became relatively quiet. Four days into March, Amazon released an official statement for those who can remote should do so.</p>\n<p>In mid-March, supermarkets started to run low on supplies as everyone bought copious amounts of toilet paper and non-perishables. Overnight, toilet paper became the symbol of power, wealth, and influence as a new post-apocalyptic society was propped up favoring the toilet-paper rich. <em>Just kidding</em>. Costco ultimately became the symbolism of mass hysteria and panic buying when customers started to <a href=\"https://nextshark.com/costco-rice-panic-buying-food/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">demand refunds on their extra goods</a>.</p>\n<p>When it came to the virus, I think Tom Hanks contracting it and the NBA suspending its entire season struck a chord with most Americans. It was no laughing matter at this point. Walking through the streets of Seattle suddenly felt unnatural. There was no honking at rush hour, no tourists at Pike Place Market, and no customers at shops and restaurants.</p>\n<p>When it came to grocery shopping, one of the hardest hit were businesses of the Asian community. While there were long lines at Costco, Target, and QFC, Asian grocery stores such as Uwajimaya and Hmart saw steady to even sometimes fewer customers. Don't get me wrong, I thought it was great not having to wait in long lines just to check out a couple of items. But it does raise the question of how long these businesses can sustain themselves with <strong>no</strong> line.</p>\n<h3>some positives.</h3>\n<p>As spread continued to worsen in other parts of the country, there was at least some hope at the original epicenter. The overall number of people contracting and dying from COVID-19 began to slow down, with death rates going from <strong>doubling every 3 days</strong> to <strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/21/upshot/coronavirus-deaths-by-country.html?action=click&#x26;module=moreIn&#x26;pgtype=Article&#x26;region=Footer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">doubling every 13 days</a></strong> at the time of me writing this. It still isn't great, but it is comforting to see that progress is being made. This doesn't mean that it is completely safe, but comforting knowing that we may no longer be confined indoors.</p>\n<p>Summers are truly a blessing in Seattle and it's just around the corner. Seattle only gets 152 sunny days per year versus the US average of 205 days and you will be way better off heading out whenever you can. Just imagine this: little to no thunderstorms, constantly sunny, daily highs in the 70s (and no hotter), bearable humidity, and darkness setting in at 10 pm. This lasts for about maybe until October and then it's back to shitty weather. I seriously cannot wait to head out to explore.</p>\n<p>Stay indoors and wash your hands.</p>","id":"f0c79373-0dd2-5c2e-8dbd-91ec20f8d4c5","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-4-12-seattle.rain.corona/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-04-12T18:16:42.177Z","path":"/seattle.rain.corona","title":"seattle. rain. corona.","description":"A brief update to my life.","tags":["seattle","moving","amazon","life"]}}},"next":null}}}
