First, I graduated. Second, I moved to the emerald city. Third, I started my job at AWS. </p>\n<p>And side note, <a href=\"https://polaritybrowser.netlify.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Polarity 10</a> is out. Y'all better check it out ðŸ’Ž.</p>\n<h3>moving.</h3>\n<p>To say this wasn't a big adjustment would just be a straight lie. Despite having lived here prior for ~3 months, picking up my entire life from one place to the next is much easier said than done. There was a lot of planning involved in what to purchase and coordinating with the building manager on how to handle items being shipped there before I arrived. Having landed in Seattle before ðŸ’© hit the fan, I was spared the excess crowds and lack of necessities at Costco.</p>\n<p>Everything had to be either delivered or transported using Lyft, which meant that cost was sky-high.  Seriously, I don't think I've spent more time and money in a month than the two months I spent physically moving and buying all the things I needed. Luckily, I was able to explore much of Seattle's food scene while I waited for the rest of my kitchen supplies to get shipped. Streets were filled despite the cold and at this time, the panic didn't hit anyone. Things were looking pretty good.</p>\n<h3>beer virus.</h3>\n<p>Things were looking less good by early March. Infections were picking up in the Seattle area without any sign of slowing down. Businesses started to close, some employees were told to work from home if they presented symptoms, and some woke up to find that they lost their jobs. Test kits were scarce but the panic still hasn't set in. Stores were still stocked with goods, restaurants were still open, and I went to a party. Maybe you'll see a couple of people here and there wearing masks, but that's about it. Pretty much everyone was either unable to get one or <strong>kept perpetuating the idea that they are largely ineffective</strong>. Over the next few days, the traffic on the I-5 became sparse and the office became relatively quiet. Four days into March, Amazon released an official statement for those who can remote should do so.</p>\n<p>In mid-March, supermarkets started to run low on supplies as everyone bought copious amounts of toilet paper and non-perishables. Overnight, toilet paper became the symbol of power, wealth, and influence as a new post-apocalyptic society was propped up favoring the toilet-paper rich. <em>Just kidding</em>. Costco ultimately became the symbolism of mass hysteria and panic buying when customers started to <a href=\"https://nextshark.com/costco-rice-panic-buying-food/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">demand refunds on their extra goods</a>.</p>\n<p>When it came to the virus, I think Tom Hanks contracting it and the NBA suspending its entire season struck a chord with most Americans. It was no laughing matter at this point. Walking through the streets of Seattle suddenly felt unnatural. There was no honking at rush hour, no tourists at Pike Place Market, and no customers at shops and restaurants.</p>\n<p>When it came to grocery shopping, one of the hardest hit were businesses of the Asian community. While there were long lines at Costco, Target, and QFC, Asian grocery stores such as Uwajimaya and Hmart saw steady to even sometimes fewer customers. Don't get me wrong, I thought it was great not having to wait in long lines just to check out a couple of items. But it does raise the question of how long these businesses can sustain themselves with <strong>no</strong> line.</p>\n<h3>some positives.</h3>\n<p>As spread continued to worsen in other parts of the country, there was at least some hope at the original epicenter. The overall number of people contracting and dying from COVID-19 began to slow down, with death rates going from <strong>doubling every 3 days</strong> to <strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/21/upshot/coronavirus-deaths-by-country.html?action=click&#x26;module=moreIn&#x26;pgtype=Article&#x26;region=Footer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">doubling every 13 days</a></strong> at the time of me writing this. It still isn't great, but it is comforting to see that progress is being made. This doesn't mean that it is completely safe, but comforting knowing that we may no longer be confined indoors.</p>\n<p>Summers are truly a blessing in Seattle and it's just around the corner. Seattle only gets 152 sunny days per year versus the US average of 205 days and you will be way better off heading out whenever you can. Just imagine this: little to no thunderstorms, constantly sunny, daily highs in the 70s (and no hotter), bearable humidity, and darkness setting in at 10 pm. This lasts for about maybe until October and then it's back to shitty weather. I seriously cannot wait to head out to explore.</p>\n<p>Stay indoors and wash your hands.</p>","timeToRead":4,"fields":{"slug":"/posts/2020-4-12-seattle.rain.corona/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"April 12, 2020","path":"/seattle.rain.corona","tags":["seattle","moving","amazon","life"],"title":"seattle. rain. corona.","image":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/53725f5ee8b34e7579f27dd87af231eb/9d169/hyatt.jpg"},"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAhABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQABAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQBAgMF/8QAFgEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwIA/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAGvTkcd2G3lWSdTu1IuZegKXhy//8QAGxAAAwADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECETEyAyH/2gAIAQEAAQUCRVCFaGTp6l5iS38XOaRXPnyf/8QAFxEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQEf/aAAgBAwEBPwGMwU//xAAXEQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAR/9oACAECAQE/AdiNHP/EABgQAAMBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQIDFB/9oACAEBAAY/AnsCOor/xAAeEAADAAIBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhMVEQYXGBof/aAAgBAQABPyFoNsWDNWmg0T4Hr56FrIsew2C748Dpo/RXEjoPoFo//9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABALHoF0H//EABkRAAEFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABESExUf/aAAgBAwEBPxBtCICw/8QAGREAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQETEh/9oACAECAQE/EOsh0mUMx//EAB4QAQACAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESFBMVFxocGx/9oACAEBAAE/EKuGFVA7iykq7jtIitQLRAkeV9yrAi9zUF8b4zM3zEF2wrcqxSUqwjUWGDm8PyeofZ7D8nFP/9k=","aspectRatio":0.6022727272727273,"src":"/blog/static/53725f5ee8b34e7579f27dd87af231eb/7e27d/hyatt.jpg","srcSet":"/blog/static/53725f5ee8b34e7579f27dd87af231eb/c9a0f/hyatt.jpg 212w,\n/blog/static/53725f5ee8b34e7579f27dd87af231eb/022b8/hyatt.jpg 424w,\n/blog/static/53725f5ee8b34e7579f27dd87af231eb/7e27d/hyatt.jpg 848w,\n/blog/static/53725f5ee8b34e7579f27dd87af231eb/10d63/hyatt.jpg 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px"}}},"description":"A brief update to my life."}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://spiderpig86.github.io"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2020-4-12-seattle.rain.corona/","prev":{"node":{"excerpt":"It's July.

You've done a lot of the touristy and fun things in Seattle where you are now sitting on your bed, scrolling through the Amazon slack to find stuff to do.</p>\n<p>You stop at \"Entrepreneurial Intern Event @ Pioneer Square Labs\" and think, <em>this is something new</em>. And in bold, <strong>food and drinks provided</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Hmm...</em></p>\n<h2>Are Meetups Pointless?</h2>\n<p>You know I'm always down for anything that is remotely associated with any free food and drink. With nothing else scheduled, this doesn't seem too bad of an event to attend. It would probably just consist of a bunch of VCs and \"CEOs\" to brag about their successes and poach aspiring developers. The very fact that this is an intern and invite-only event makes it seem that it was only organized to siphon talent from Microsoft, Amazon, etcâ€¦</p>\n<p>Looking into Reddit for what these events are like, I found <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/5k57y1/rant_i_am_so_tired_of_going_to_entrepreneur/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/6szd8b/do_real_entrepreneurs_actually_attend_meetups_for/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/9uexow/advice_reddit_please/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this</a>. It seems that these Redditors have far from a favorable view of these entrepreneurial meetups in general, one commenting \"My god, this is the largest group of self-delusional 'wantrepreneurs' I have ever met\".</p>\n<p>Not wanting to be the only one \"networking\", I got another intern on my team to tag along.</p>\n<p>Until now, my knowledge on startups and entrepreneurship just comprised of a hodgepodge of Gary Vaynerchuk videos on YouTube, Silicon Valley, and this <a href=\"https://github.com/words/buzzwords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">handy library</a> of all the obnoxious buzzwords that HR loves to throw around to woo in potential candidates on LinkedIn. In short, not very extensive so I was willing to give it a shot.</p>\n<h2>The Meetup</h2>\n<p>Pioneer Square in Seattle is known to be the city's first settlement, hence the word \"Pioneer\". But over the years, the area has vastly transformed which now features shopping carts filled with trash bags, worn down tents, and your local guy tripping out of his mind.</p>\n<p>In the midst of all this lies a startup studio, <a href=\"https://www.psl.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pioneer Square Labs</a>. After walking in, an employee quickly escorted us to the third floor where other interns were mingling and drinking copious amounts of  <em>La Croixâ„¢</em>. The elevator doors opened to an open office featuring a rugged design mixed with Cedarwood running from the floor to the roof and string lights that came straight out of a college dorm featured on Instagram.</p>\n<p>\"The meetup is to my left\", said one employee as he scooted us to the thing we came for, the pizza.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/images/pioneer-square-labs/pizza.jpg\" alt=\"The More You Know\"></p>\n<p>There were little clusters of interns mingling about. Some were business and some were software engineering. In general, a good chunk of them come from companies like Microsoft and Amazon along with other startups in the region.</p>\n<p>Once we were satiated with the amount of pizza and drinks we got, the presentation finally began with an \"Omaha\" (forgive me since memory seems to fail me while writing this) which is a tradition they have in encouraging someone to give a speech. In simple terms, it's just cheering exceptionally loud from a much smaller crowd. Cute.</p>\n<p>The very first to speak was a co-founder of the incubator, <a href=\"https://www.psl.com/team/greg-gottesman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Greg Gottesman</a>, who is also an adjunct professor at the University of Washington teaching entrepreneurship. Having found several successful companies in the past in addition to being a professor, I have no questions about his credibility.</p>\n<p>Up until now, I was only interested in killing some time and getting free food. However, it was at this point where I started to truly listen.</p>\n<p>Soon after, the CEOs of several startups spoke. What I had initially expected was an entire hour of speakers going up and boasting about their successes and throw around a bunch of fancy buzzwords that would attract young developers like myself. However, I could not have been more wrong.</p>\n<p>The main takeaway from what these speakers said was that <em>nothing in life was set in stone</em>. The founder of <strong>Glow</strong>, a platform designed to simplify podcast subscriptions, spoke about her transition from working in the US government to solve a fundamental problem in something she loved. The founder of <strong>SingleFile</strong>, a company aimed to make state and local regulations compliance much easier for starting companies, went from studying law to doing tech. As cheesy and cliche of a saying it is, the future is always full of uncertainties.</p>\n<p>The second part was more of a discussion with two current employees in PSL â€” one handling business operations and one principal data scientist. One major part of their discussion was about the process of how they vet prospective partnerships with other founders. The one thing that stuck out to me was how much data analysis was involved even in the initial stages of launching something new to prove if something was viable or not.</p>\n<p>A quick rundown of what this process looks like is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An initial trial run is created which consisted of many variations of the given idea marketing-wise. This means different variations of landing pages, designs, and marketing campaigns across Facebook and Google ads.</li>\n<li>After some time, the <strong>CTR</strong> (click-through rate) is assessed and a decision is made for continuing the idea. Most ideas that don't do well tend to end here.</li>\n<li>Additional optimizations are made and designs/ideas begin to become a lot more polished.</li>\n<li>Teams start to form where people of PSL meet with the client.</li>\n<li>At this point, the stages start to blur a bit as you meet with different partners (VCs) and begin assembling your team to help build your company.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I can guarantee you that the process is a lot more nuanced than what I have stated above.</p>\n<p>There were some great examples of ideas that didn't work, such as a radiation detector made from RAM chips. This by softening the memory bits which hold state (0 or 1) by constantly writing and reading them over and over again. The repeated nature of reading and writing is destructive to DRAM (DDR3 and DDR4) and it is very similar to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_hammer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">row hammer</a> method used for modifying bits of memory for privilege escalation. When this idea was tested out, this was only effective in weakening a very minuscule portion of memory, making the production process long and arduous.</p>\n<p>Another idea was paying someone else to pick up packages for you. That in itself opens up a whole other can of worms. Things to take into account are the people that are willing to pay someone, like their neighbor, to accept packages in the first place and security and trust concerns that may arise.</p>\n<p>When it comes to working at a startup studio like this, many positive remarks were made on the flexibility of being able to do the things that they enjoy. For instance, the data scientist stated that he was able to be a \"mad scientist\" of sorts working on a bunch of crazy new ideas and solving complex problems for clients. And these ideas are quite interesting since founders try to be as novel as they possibly can with the problems they try to solve.</p>\n<p>As the event started to wind down, the employees and co-founders \"avuncular\" advice as one put it. The upshot from this part was that even in your early to mid-twenties, it is a great time to try out new ideas and pursue them relentlessly. The time is now to work on that idea for 6 months and see where it goes from there. The time is now to make mistakes so that it would serve as the cornerstone for any prospective startup.</p>\n<p>Although my initial intent was to go there for just the food and drinks, I ended up walking away with greater knowledge on how ideas are usually trialed and all the stages that occur even after an idea is pitched. The very idea that an entrepreneurial course was offered in any school for computer science to me is new given that my school did not have one. I firmly believe that the knowledge that could be gained in such a class teaching this very topic is tantamount to creativity in solving problems and the ability to learn quickly on your feet in this field.</p>\n<p>Despite the antagonistic view that some parts of Reddit had for such events, this one has certainly evinced that they are worthwhile. Who knows, you may meet a future mentor at one of these meetups or hear some profound speech that could have a major impact on the decisions you make later in your lifetime. </p>\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: I am not affiliated with PSL in any shape or form.

Introducing COBOL, the language that makes C look like child's play.</p>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p>COBOL, or <strong>Co</strong>mmon <strong>B</strong>usiness-<strong>O</strong>riented <strong>L</strong>anguage, is a highly-verbose compiled language designed to run on mainframes powered by operating systems like z/OS from IBM. Designed in 1959, it was heavily inspired by the FLOW-MATIC language designed by Grace Hopper which features the same imperative and verbose syntax. The sole purpose of the language is to handle massive amounts of throughput in industries including airline ticketing, insurance claims, banking, and unemployment claims.</p>\n<p>So you might be wondering, why are we relying on such an old language to process business-critical transactions that affect millions of people? It is certainly not popular as indicated by its low ranking in the <a href=\"https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TIOBE Index</a> and with the advent of new/established languages such as Java, Python, and Go, new programmers have little reason to explore the world of COBOL.</p>\n<p>The interest to upgrade and change is there, but businesses that rely on COBOL are stuck between a rock and a hard place. First, the cost of replacing all of the existing infrastructure and code base with a newer language can be very time consuming and costly. In 2012, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia took on this <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-cobol/banks-scramble-to-fix-old-systems-as-it-cowboys-ride-into-sunset-idUSKBN17C0D8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">herculian task to transition its systems from COBOL to SAP ABAP</a>. In total, the update took 5 whole years, 1 billion Australian dollars (USD 749 million), and the assistance of 2 other companies (Accenture and SAP). Upgrading isn't impossible, it's just extremely costly.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/USA-BANKS-COBOL/010040KH18J/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reuters</a>, it seems that COBOL won't be going anywhere anytime soon. Also with the lack of COBOL developers to help with the migration, it looks like these systems would be here to stay for years to come. With the Coronavirus outbreak, the lack is more apparent than ever as unemployment processing systems in New Jersey were failing under the spike in unemployment claims. It's not that the system was failing its job, but the changing environment has made it inadequate.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We have systems that are 40-plus years old. Thereâ€™ll be lots of postmortems, and one of them will be <em>how the heck did we get here?,</em> when we literally needed COBOL programmers.\" - Gov. Murphy of New Jersey</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When I first heard him say this on the news, I thought it was a joke. I initially thought that a majority of our systems would've at least been upgraded to something newer, but I guess I was just uninformed.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Unexpected <a href=\"https://t.co/A00tViNxJt\">pic.twitter.com/A00tViNxJt</a></p>&mdash; michael_nielsen (@michael_nielsen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1246577382347034625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 4, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p>If COBOL is trending on Twitter, then you know it's serious.</p>\n<h2>Hello COBOL</h2>\n<p>Now that I've got you on board, time to teach you to become a full-fledge COBOL developer. So now, we will start with the most important step to becoming a COBOL developer, writing \"hello world\".</p>\n<p>But before that, we need to do a couple of things to get it up and running on your machine. For this guide, I will be using Ubuntu. This should work the same on the Windows WSL with Ubuntu.</p>\n<p>First, we need to install a COBOL compiler. For this, we will be installing <code class=\"language-text\">open-cobol</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">sudo</span> <span class=\"token function\">apt-get</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span> open-cobol</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now, we can begin writing our program. If you were to ask me what the program structure looks like, it is a cross of MIPS Assembly and FORTRAN. </p>\n<p>We start with different sections of the program. The <code class=\"language-text\">IDENTIFICATION DIVISION</code> is used to store program properties and the <code class=\"language-text\">PROCEDURE DIVISION</code> stores the functionality. Inside the <code class=\"language-text\">PROCEDURE DIVISION</code>, we will use the <code class=\"language-text\">DISPLAY</code> command to directly write to the screen. To end the program, we add the <code class=\"language-text\">STOP RUN</code> command at the end, much like adding <code class=\"language-text\">li $v0, 10</code> in MIPS.</p>\n<p>Open a new file in any editor and call it <code class=\"language-text\">hello.cob</code>. <code class=\"language-text\">*.cob</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">*.cbl</code> are file extensions for Cobol source files.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"cobol\"><pre class=\"language-cobol\"><code class=\"language-cobol\">000000*&gt; My first COBOL program.\n000100 IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.\n000200*&gt; Identifies the name of the program\n000300 PROGRAM-ID. HELLO_WORLD.\n      \n      *&gt; Instructions go here\n      PROCEDURE DIVISION.\n        DISPLAY &#39;Hello from COBOL :)&#39;.\n        STOP RUN.</code></pre></div>\n<p>You may have noticed a couple of things about the code itself. The first 6 digits are reserved for line numbers that increment <code class=\"language-text\">100</code> per line. Comments are defined with <code class=\"language-text\">*&gt;</code>. Each program statement ends with a period, much like the English.</p>\n<p>To compile this program, simply use <code class=\"language-text\">cobc</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">cobc -x hello.cob</code></pre></div>\n<p>The compiler should generate an executable file that you can simply execute with:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">./hello</code></pre></div>\n<p>And there you have it, your first Cobol program!</p>\n<h2>Aspects of the Language</h2>\n<p>This will be a quick overview of different aspects of the programming language. If you're interested, I recommend taking a look at the references I used to understand the language. Surprisingly, the documentation isn't too bad.</p>\n<h3>Program Structure</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Each line of the source file is offset 6 spaces to the right to account for the line numbers.</li>\n<li>Programs have different sections labeled with the <code class=\"language-text\">DIVISION</code> keyword to separate the responsibilities of each part of the program.</li>\n<li>\n<p>The first division is the <code class=\"language-text\">IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.</code> which stores the metadata that describes the program (<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_ibm_i_73/rzasb/iddiv.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">docs</a>).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-text\">PROGRAM-ID</code> paragraph allows you to specify the name of the program (<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_ibm_i_73/rzasb/progid.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">docs</a>).</li>\n<li>There can be other paragraphs, but those are optional.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The second division is the <code class=\"language-text\">ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.</code>, which is an optional section where you can define program configuration and inputs/outputs (<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_ibm_i_73/rzasb/envcfg.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">docs</a>).</li>\n<li>\n<p>The third section is the <code class=\"language-text\">DATA DIVISION.</code> that specifies the internal and external data the program will work with.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The variables must be specified in the <code class=\"language-text\">WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Last but not least, the <code class=\"language-text\">PROCEDURE DIVISION.</code> is essentially the <code class=\"language-text\">main()</code> function of our program. All of our wonderful spaghetti code goes here.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"cobol\"><pre class=\"language-cobol\"><code class=\"language-cobol\">      IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.\n        PROGRAM-ID. MY-PROGRAM.\n      \n      DATA DIVISION.\n        WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.\n        *&gt; Variables go here.\n      \n      PROCEDURE DIVISION.\n        *&gt; Functionality goes here.</code></pre></div>\n<h3>Variables</h3>\n<p>Variables are pretty unique in COBOL. Instead of defining a type, it seems you specify what the variables hold as a composite of different types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A - alphabetic</li>\n<li>X - alphanumeric</li>\n<li>V - decimal</li>\n<li>S - sign</li>\n<li>9 - numeric</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, a floating-point number with 3 digits and 2 digits of precision would look something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"cobol\"><pre class=\"language-cobol\"><code class=\"language-cobol\">        01 MY-FLOAT PIC S9(3)V9(2). VALUE +987.65.</code></pre></div>\n<p>Note that a value does not need to be specified for the variable. The best way I can sum up variable declaration is that we use the different symbols to represent the structure of the value that will be stored, much like how regex can be used to match different words/expressions.</p>\n<p>The numbers appearing on the left-hand side specify the level of the variable for nesting data just like how classes/struct can be used to wrap around other variables.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"cobol\"><pre class=\"language-cobol\"><code class=\"language-cobol\">      01 PERSON-ADDRESS.\n        05 HOUSE-NUMBER PIC 9(4).\n        05 STREET PIC X(24).\n        05 CITY PIC X(24).\n        05 COUNTRY PIC X(24) VALUE &#39;BELGIUM&#39;.</code></pre></div>\n<p>This is a very brief overview of variables, but I highly recommend looking at <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSUFAU_2.0.0/com.ibm.debugtool.doc/rmdita/rcmddco.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">documentation from IBM</a> to learn more.</p>\n<h3>Conditionals</h3>\n<p>Conditionals are quite self-explanatory given how it reads like plain English barring a couple of symbols.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"cobol\"><pre class=\"language-cobol\"><code class=\"language-cobol\">      PROCEDURE DIVISION.\n        *&gt; Initialize variables with numbers\n        MOVE 30 TO A.\n        MOVE 20 TO B.\n        MOVE 30 TO C.\n        \n        IF A &gt; B THEN\n            DISPLAY &#39;A &gt; B&#39;\n            IF A = C THEN\n                DISPLAY &#39;A = C&#39;\n            ELSE\n                DISPLAY &#39;A != C&#39;\n            END IF.\n        ELSE\n            DISPLAY &#39;A &lt;= B&#39;\n        END IF.</code></pre></div>\n<p>For switch statements, we specify the value to <code class=\"language-text\">switch</code> on (statement in Java) to be <code class=\"language-text\">True</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"cobol\"><pre class=\"language-cobol\"><code class=\"language-cobol\">      EVALUATE TRUE\n        WHEN A &lt; 20\n            DISPLAY &#39;A IS LESS THAN 20&#39;\n        WHEN A &lt; 30\n            DISPLAY &#39;A IS LESS THAN 30&#39;\n        WHEN A &lt; 40\n            DISPLAY &#39;A IS LESS THAN 40&#39;\n      END-EVALUATE.</code></pre></div>\n<p>Conditionals can also be combined with <code class=\"language-text\">NOT</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">AND</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">OR</code>, and some others.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"cobol\"><pre class=\"language-cobol\"><code class=\"language-cobol\">          IF A IS LESS THAN B AND A IS LESS THAN 50 THEN\n        DISPLAY &#39;THIS IS IN FACT TRUE&#39;\n      ELSE\n        DISPLAY &#39;THIS SHOULD NOT SHOW&#39;\n      END-IF.\n      \n      *&gt; Combined conditional without else\n      IF A IS POSITIVE OR A IS NEGATIVE THEN\n        DISPLAY &#39;A IS POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE&#39;.</code></pre></div>\n<p>For further reference, there is a lot written about <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSUFAU_1.0.0/com.ibm.debugtool.doc/rmdita/rcmdico.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how to implement conditionals</a>.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of other aspects of the language not shown here such as commands, strings, loops, file I/O, etc. </p>\n<h3>Now for the important question.</h3>\n<p><strong>Can COBOL be used for Leetcode?</strong> Absolutely. Allow me to demonstrate.</p>\n<p>For today's problem, we will be doing <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Leetcode 326</a>. <em>Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of three.</em> And for the follow-up, <em>could you do it without using any loop / recursion?</em></p>\n<p>For the solution below, we will accomplish both. The first solution that comes to keep dividing the given number, <code class=\"language-text\">n</code>, by 3 and see if the remainder is 0 at the end. However, that did not fit in with the follow-up and I got too tired to figure out how to write a loop, so we will use the change of base formula instead.</p>\n<p>i = log<sub>b</sub>(n)/log<sub>b</sub>(3)</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"cobol\"><pre class=\"language-cobol\"><code class=\"language-cobol\">      IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.\n           PROGRAM-ID.
