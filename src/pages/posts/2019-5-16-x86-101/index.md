<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

You might be wondering why I would subject myself to torture by trying to learn Assembly in the first place since it's "either too hard" or "it's boring as hell". Well you're right, it's definitely not the most interesting thing in the world. Since I'm taking a course of offensive security, I *kinda* need to at least understand the basics of it -- mainly to understand program disassembling for CTF.

So far, there aren't too many simple guides on learning x86 online compared to other languages. So hopefully, this will be a quick and easy guide for you to follow to learn the very basics of x86. :smile:

<h2 id="what">What is x86?</h2>

*Worse than MIPS*. Just kidding. x86 is a variant of **Assembly** that is commonly written for x86-64 processors which are CISC processors (common in most desktop computers today). x86 is more complex than, let's say, MIPS in the sense that it is designed to complete tasks with only a few instructions rather than using more basic instructions <a href="#references">[1]</a>.

For example, CISC architectures come with a built-in instruction that performs multiplication without breaking it up into a series of smaller instructions. In the RISC approach, multiplication is actually broken up into a series of a few instructions <a href="#references">[2]</a>.

```nasm
; CISC approach
; Imagine if dval1 = 0x5 and dval2 = 0x6
mov eax, dval1 ; Move the first value to accumulator
mul dval2 ; Multiply into eax
```

In the RISC approach, it is broken up into a series of other steps.

```js
LOAD A, 2
LOAD B, 3
PROD A, B
STORE A, RES
```

<h2 id="components">Program Components</h2>

Before we get started with the x86 language, first we must understand the main sections of a program written in C. This will be a very brief guide since there is plenty of info online. Note that what I will be talking about is the 32-bit variant of the x86 architecture.

### Heap

The **heap** is a section of **unmanaged** memory (in Java, there's GC so technically it is managed there) that is allocated by the operating system. The OS uses the `sysbrk` syscall to allocate memory from the requesting function. Unlike the stack, memory is not invalidated when the function returns which leads to memory leaks. To avoid this, in C you would release memory with `free()` after a call to `malloc()` or one of its variants. Heap grows **upward** towards higher memory addresses.

### Stack

This refers to the region of memory that is allocated to the process **primarily to implement functions**. This is managed in the sense that the variables created remain local to the function it resides and is invalidated once the function exits (when the [stack pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_register) moves up). The values are still there, but they will be overwritten by the contents of the next function call's [stack frame](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10057443/explain-the-concept-of-a-stack-frame-in-a-nutshell). Two x86 registers that deal with this are:

 * `esp` (extended stack pointer) - points to the top of the stack where `push` and `pop` will decrement and increment the stack pointer respectively. `push` adds an element to the top of the stack while `pop` removes the element at the top of the stack.
 * `ebp` (extended base pointer) - points to the start of the current **stack frame**, which is the space allocated for a function call. The `call` instruction pushes the current instruction pointer onto the stack.

Note that the stack grows **downward** towards lower memory addresses. This is also where global and static variables are declared.

<h3 id="registers">Registers</h3>

These are small storage units located directly in the processor for quick access to intermediate values in function calls. It is known as L0 cache and it is located at the highest level in the [memory hierarchy](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-hierarchy-design-and-its-characteristics/).

There are six 32-bit general purpose registers in the x86 architecture <a href="#references">[3]</a>:

 * `eax` (extended accumulator register) - used for storing return values for functions and special register for certain calculations.

    * ```nasm
      mov eax, 3  ; Set eax to 3
      ret ; Return
      ```

 * `ebx` (extended base register) - often set to commonly used values to speed up calculations.

 * `ecx` (extended counter register) - used as a function parameter or a loop counter. Generally used with *for loops* as the counter.

 * `edx` (extended data register) - also used as a function parameter register like `ecx` and storing **short-term variables** within a function.

 * `esi` (extended source index register) - register that points to the where the "source" is located in memory.

 * `edi` (extended data index register) - similar to `esi`, but it points to the destination. 

`ebp`, `esp`, and `eip` are all known as **reserved** registers.

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>

### Format

There are essentially two schools of thought for instruction format: the **AT&T syntax** and the **Intel syntax**.

In short, the difference is that for the **AT&T syntax**, the source register is on the left side and the destination register is on the right side while it is the opposite for the **Intel syntax**.

Instructions typically follow 2 forms:

* `op arg` - there is an operation with only one argument specified.
* `op arg1, arg2` - there is an operation with two arguments specified, separated by a comma.

As an example with the `mov` instruction, it copies the value that is stored by the second argument into the first argument.

```nasm
mov arg1, arg2
```

![syntax](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/images/x86/x86-add.PNG)

Although it is called `mov`, it actually **copies** instead, meaning that the value stored in `arg2` is actually still there. However, there are some caveats with this specific instruction in general discussed in the next section.

### Dereferencing

The caveat comes when you are trying to get values from the stack.

When you are trying to get values from the stack, let's say moving a local variable at `ebp - 12 (0xC)` with a value of 42, you would expect that you would get the value that is stored at that location into `eax`. This means that `eax` should have the value of 42 right?

```nasm
mov eax, ebp-0xC
```

**WRONG**

`ebp - 0xC` is an address that refers to where 42 is stored in memory. Simply calling `mov` will move that address into `eax`, but not 42. If you know C, you know that we would need to **dereference** a pointer to get the value at that location. In x86, a similar idea also exists where we can think of using the square bracket notation as a dereference operator.

So to get 42, we would run this:

```nasm
mov eax, [ebp-0xC]
```

![dereferencing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/images/x86/x86-deref.PNG)

<h2 id="math">Math</h2>
Of course, x86 supports the basic mathematical operators that you would need to perform more complex computations.

**Addition**

The `add` instruction is a binary operation that adds two given registers with the format `add arg1, arg2` which is the same as `arg1 = arg1 + arg2`. The first and second arguments are summed and stored in the first argument.

```nasm
add eax, 0x5
```

![adding](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/images/x86/x86-add.PNG)

The instruction above adds the value in `%eax` with 5 and stores it back in `%eax`.

**Subtraction**

This is a binary operation that subtracts the second argument from the first: `sub arg1, arg2` is the same as `arg1 = arg1 - arg2`.

```nasm
sub esp, 0x4
```
The instruction above moves the stack pointer down 4 bytes.
This can also be done by adding a negative value with a lower overhead.

![subtracting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/images/x86/x86-sub.PNG)

**Multiplication**

Multiplication is a bit more complex since it comes with several varying instructions.
Also, its destination register varies depending on the memory size of the value you are multiplying with.

*Note: The terminology here is different than with other architectures. A **word** is 16 bits (size of the register) and a **doubleword** is 32 bits.*

1. Multiplying 2 bytes
   
     * This is a common case where we move one of the operands into register `%AX`. Then, we call `mul <arg2>` which would perform `%AX = %AX * arg2`, where `arg2` is some register and **not** an immediate.
  
2. Multiplying 2 words (16 bits)
   
     * This operation performs multiplication with two 16 bit values.
     * The multiplicand, or number being multiplied, is stored in the `%AX` register and the multiplier is a word stored in memory or another register.
     * The syntax is similar to before, where we call `mul <arg2>` which performs `%(DX:AX) = %AX & arg2`.
       * The result is actually stored in two registers. 
     * Since this allows for much larger results, the product of two words can result in a doubleword, which means it needs two registers to store the entire result.
       * `%DX` holds the upper 16 bits of the result while `%AX` holds the bottom 16 bits.
  
3. Multiplying 2 doublewords (32 bits)

     * The idea is similar here, but we use the **extended** versions of registers such as `%EAX` and `%EDX`.
     * This is also called as `mul <arg2>`.
     * the result of this could be a `qword` or **quadword**, so we would need to use 2 *extended* registers to store the result.
       * `%(EDX:EAX) = %EAX * arg2`.
         * Both `%EDX` and `%EAX` store 32 bits.
         * Like before, `%EDX` stores the upper 32 bits and `%EAX` stores the lower 32 bits.

* Of course there is `imul`, which handles **signed multiplication**.

**Division**

Like with multiplication, division also has the same rules for dealing with different size divisors

1. Divisor is 1 byte

     * First, we place our dividend (number we are dividing into) in `%AX`.
     * The divisor is then another register or memory location we specify that has the divisor, so the operation works like this: `%AX / arg2`.
     * The result will be stored in **two** registers: `%AL` and `%AH` which store the quotient and remainder respectively.
     * To perform this, call `div <arg2>`

2. Divisor is 1 word

     * Here, the main difference is that the dividend (32 bits) is placed into the `%(DX:AX)` registers where the upper 16 bits are in `%DX` and the lower 16 bits are in `%AX`.
     * After dividing, the 16-bit quotient goes into `%AX` and the 16-bit remainder goes into `%DX`

3. Divisor is a doubleword

     * The dividend here is assumed to be 64 bits stored along the `%(EDX:EAX)` registers.
     * After dividing, the quotient goes into `%EAX` and the remainder goes into `%EDX`.


<h2 id="stackops">Stack Based Operations</h2>

Stack based operators are design to manipulate registers that correspond with the stack pointer, such as `%esp` and `%ebp`.
Keep in mind that the stack pointer grows downward in memory, so the "top" of the stack is really at the bottom.

**Push**

* The `push` instruction is designed to put stuff on the top of the stack.
  * How it accomplishes this is by decrementing `%esp` by 4 bytes (to allocate space for an address on 32 bit systems) and then places the value inside those 4 bytes.
    ```
    push <arg>
    ```

**Pop**

* The `pop` instruction is used to pop or remove data from the top of the stack pointed by `%esp`.
  * This works by incrementing `%esp` by 4 bytes (on 32 bit systems) and copies the value to the corresponding register.
  * The actual data isn't cleared itself on the stack, but since the stack pointer is above it, the data will be overwritten the next time the stack pointer goes past there.
    ```
    pop <register>
    ```

![stack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/images/x86/x86-stack.PNG)

<h2 id="lea">Lea</h2>

This instruction stands for **load effective address**.

It places the address of the corresponding value specified in the second argment and places it into the register specified by the first argument.

The instruction was mainly included to add support to higher level languages like C where it wants the address of some value whether they are arrays or structs. It would be equivalent to the `&` operator in C.
Let's say we have a struct defined in C like this:
  ```C
  struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
    int z;
  }
  ```
If we were to access the the z coordinate of an array of `Points` inside some for loop, we would run something like this:
  ```C
  int z = points[i].z;
  ```
In x86, the equivalent statement would be:
  ```nasm
  MOV EDX, [EBX + 12 * EAX + 8]
  ```
  * Recall that the `MOV` instruction is used for moving values from the second argument to the first.
  * The brackets are used as a *dereference* operator to get the associated value at that address.
  * We are assuming that `%EBX` contains the base address of the array and `%EAX` contains the counter variable.
  * Assuming a **4-byte alignment**, we multiply the counter `%EAX` by `12` since the `Point` struct has a size of `12` bytes (from 3 32-bit integers).
  * The offset to get the `z` variable is `8` bytes since there are 2 preceding integers, `x` and `y`.
Now that's great for getting the value we want, but what if we just wanted the actual address in memory.
In C, the `&` operator comes in handy and we can write something like this:
  ```C
  int* p = &points[i].z;
  ```
  * The code above will get the address of the `z` varible in the struct and store that in an int pointer `p`.
Below is the is the compiled version of the code, where we load the address into register `%ESI`.
  ```nasm
  LEA ESI, [EBX + 12 * EAX + 8]
  ```

![load effective address](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/images/x86/x86-lea.PNG)

**But Stan, Wait!**

*Can't we just do the same thing by writing `MOV ESI, EBX + 12 * EAX + 8`?*

Well no, we cannot. The explanation will be come clear after reading a *riveting* discussion on Stackoverflow spanning 2011 - 2018 <a href="#references">[4]</a>.

To simply put it, here are the main points of why that is not possible:
  1. The `MOV` instruction is not designed for just calculating the address of a given memory location. Its job is to **access** whatever value is stored at that address, meaning it actually takes extra time to **read** the contents of that memory location. `LEA` just does the math on the given values.
  2. It is not valid to perform some form of computation without some brackets or parenthesis.
  3. Assuming that there is a specialized function for `MOV` that did allow for the line of code above, it would make the syntax less clean. It is subjective, but it is much easier to distiguish loading from memory and calculating an address if you have 2 different instructions.

There are probably more reasons, but in general, having a dedicated instruction for calculating addresses is a lot cleaner and more optimized than overloading an existing instruction which increases complexity and decreases readability.

<h2 id="compare">Compare</h2>

The `cmp` instruction is actually the same as the `sub` instruction  except that instead of storing the result in the first first argument, it will set a **flag** in the processor.
The instruction can be executed as `cmp arg1, arg2`.

That **flag** will have these possible values:
  1. `< 0` - `arg1 < arg2`
  2. `0` - `arg1 == arg2`
  3. `> 0` - `arg1 > arg2`
  
![compare](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/images/x86/x86-cmp.PNG)

The **flag** being stored is actually the value of `arg1 - arg2`.
As an example, this is how it would work:
  ```nasm
  cmp 1, 3
  ```
  * This instruction would perform `1 - 3`, setting `-2` inside the flag which tells us that `arg1 < arg2`.
  * Keep in mind that this is not really a valid way since we cannot compare 2 immediates directly.
  * The first argument is usually a register while the second one can either be an immediate or a register.

Now there are many other examples of using the `cmp` instruction along with many other acceptable arguments, which can all be found here <a href="#references">[5]</a>.

<h2 id="jump">Jump</h2>

Typically when using the `cmp` instruction above, it is followed by a `jmp` or **jump** instruction. This instruction takes in a single argument for the jump address as its parameter.

```nasm
jmp addr
```

The jump will be taken based on the value of the **flag** in the processor. When a jump is taken, the `eip` register is set is set to that argument. Of course, there are many variants of the jump instruction that change the flow of the program based on the value of the **flag**. The `jmp` instruction shown above is the **unconditional jump**.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of the different jump instructions that exist. These are mainly the common ones.

  * `je` (jump equal) - jumps if equal
  * `jz` (jump zero) - jump if zero
  * `jl` (jump less) - jump if less
  * `jg` (jump greater) - jump if greater

There are plenty more that can be found [here](http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/x86-jumps.html) <a href="#references">[6]</a>.

Below is an example program written in pseudocode on how it may work. Addresses are on the left and instructions are on the right, assume that the `eip` points to `addr3`:
  ```nasm
  addr1 instr1
  addr2 cmp 1, 3
  addr3 jl addr10
  addr4 instr4
  ...   ...
  addr10 instr10
  ```
  * Looking at the example above, the jump would be taken to `addr10` since `1 < 3` and we are using `jl`, meaning jump if the first argument is less than the second.
  * If we used `jg`, the `eip` would move to `addr4`.

Now you may have noticed that I used the word **flag** a lot in the last two sections, but what the heck is it?

The idea of the **FLAGS** register is to serve as a status register that contains the **current state of the processor**. This essentially means that this `16 bit` wide register holds a lot of information as to what is going on in the processor.

If the entire state of the CPU is stored in a single register, how do we keep track of multiple independent states?

The idea of using a single register is to save space. Luckily through **bitmasking**, we can specify a specific set of bit(s) to represent the state of a certain piece of information. In short, each flag or state information is mapped to a specific set of bits. Confusing right?

For example, let's say if we are performing some addition and a carry value has been generated by the ALU, the **carry flag** or `CF` is set to `1` to let us know that this has happened. This `1` is just 1 of the bits in the 16-bit register representing the state. To get the value of `CF` specifically, we use a mask value of `0x0001`, meaning that the **least significant bit** corresponds to the carry flag.

The most common flags that are seen are typically `CF`, `ZF`, `OF`, `PF` and `SF`. Since this is only a brief overview, you can see a much more detailed breakdown of the x86 flags [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAGS_register) <a href="#references">[7]</a>.

FLAGS register is not limited to just `16` bits, as some processors have 32 bit and 64 bit register sizes. The 32-bit variant is denoted as EFLAGS while the 64-bit variant is denoted as RFLAGS.

<h2 id="call">Call</h2>
Perhaps this is the most important instruction of them all. It is a simple instruction on the surface that takes in a single argument.

```nasm
call <func_addr>
```

This is designed to "call" a function in a program or library. When you disassemble your C program, you will notice that calls made to standard C library functions like `printf` all point to some memory address.

The way that `call` works is that it pushes the return address, or the current value of `eip`, onto the stack and jumps to the argument.

In other words, this means that `call <func_addr>` is equivalent to:

```nasm
push eip
jmp func
```

What this does is create the **stack frame** which in essence places all the parameters, the return address, and the function itself in the right order on the **stack** so it can execute and return to the caller. Every single function that is called will have its own stack frame, where the base pointer `ebp` contains the start of the stack frame and the `esp` points to the top of the stack frame.

To call a function with parameters, it would look something like this. This is what `foo(a, b, c)` would look like in x86:

```nasm
push c
push b
push a
call foo
```

Note that we always push in reverse order since a stack is **LIFO**. Recall that all the parameters are stored on the **stack**. To access them, we can write something like this:

```nasm
pop eax, [esp + 0] ; Return address
pop eax, [esp + 4] ; Parameter 'a'
pop eax, [esp + 8] ; Paramater 'b'
pop eax, [esp + 12] ; Parameter 'c'
```

Realistically, we are missing the stack base-pointer register, which helps us keep track of where the start of the stack frame is located since handling functions without it can be quite messy.

```nasm
pop eax, [ebp + 16] ; Parameter 'c'
pop eax, [ebp + 12] ; Parameter 'b'
pop eax, [ebp + 8] ; Parameter 'a'
pop eax, [ebp + 4] ; Return address
pop eax, [ebp + 0] ; Saved stack base-pointer register
```

<h2 id="leave">Leave/Ret</h2>

These two instructions are always used at the end of a given function. The `leave` instruction is always followed by the `return` instruction as seen in disassembling C programs.

These two instructions make up what we know as today as a single `return` statement in higher level languages like Java or C. They must be used together as they **clean up the stack frame** and **returns to the correct part of the program**.

```nasm
leave
ret
```

The `leave` instruction performs the clean up of the stack frame. It:
  1. Shifts `esp` to where `ebp` is located, which is the base of the stack frame for the current function (callee).
  2. Pops from the top of the stack into `ebp`, which holds the address of the old stack frame (caller).

In x86, it is `leave` is equivalent to this:

```nasm
movl ebp, esp
popl ebp
```

![leave](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/images/x86/x86-leave.PNG)

The `return` instruction takes the value at the top of the stack after `leave` is called, which is the return address to the caller, and pops it into `esp`. In the end, the program continues executing where it left off in the caller function.

![return](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/images/x86/x86-ret.PNG)

## It's time for me to leave and ret
Understanding x86 is crucial in understanding and developing future exploits of your own. I really hope this helped to make x86 seem a little less scary.

There is of course a lot more to learn, but this should lay the ground work for future research. Have fun!
