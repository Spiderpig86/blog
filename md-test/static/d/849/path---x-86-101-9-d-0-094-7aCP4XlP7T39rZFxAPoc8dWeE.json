Well you're right, it's definitely not the most interesting thing in the world. Since I'm taking a course of offensive security, I <em>kinda</em> need to at least understand the basics of it -- mainly to understand program disassembling for CTF.</p>\n<p>So far, there aren't too many simple guides on learning x86 online compared to other languages. So hopefully, this will be a quick and easy guide for you to follow to learn the very basics of x86. ðŸ˜„</p>\n<h2 id=\"what\">What is x86?</h2>\n<p><em>Worse than MIPS</em>. Just kidding. x86 is a variant of <strong>Assembly</strong> that is commonly written for x86-64 processors which are CISC processors (common in most desktop computers today). x86 is more complex than, let's say, MIPS in the sense that it is designed to complete tasks with only a few instructions rather than using more basic instructions <a href=\"#references\">[1]</a>.</p>\n<p>For example, CISC architectures come with a built-in instruction that performs multiplication without breaking it up into a series of smaller instructions. In the RISC approach, multiplication is actually broken up into a series of a few instructions <a href=\"#references\">[2]</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\"><span class=\"token comment\">; CISC approach</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">; Imagine if dval1 = 0x5 and dval2 = 0x6</span>\nmov <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, dval1 <span class=\"token comment\">; Move the first value to accumulator</span>\nmul dval2 <span class=\"token comment\">; Multiply into eax</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>In the RISC approach, it is broken up into a series of other steps.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token constant\">LOAD</span> <span class=\"token constant\">A</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span>\n<span class=\"token constant\">LOAD</span> <span class=\"token constant\">B</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">3</span>\n<span class=\"token constant\">PROD</span> <span class=\"token constant\">A</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token constant\">B</span>\n<span class=\"token constant\">STORE</span> <span class=\"token constant\">A</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token constant\">RES</span></code></pre></div>\n<h2 id=\"components\">Program Components</h2>\n<p>Before we get started with the x86 language, first we must understand the main sections of a program written in C. This will be a very brief guide since there is plenty of info online. Note that what I will be talking about is the 32-bit variant of the x86 architecture.</p>\n<h3>Heap</h3>\n<p>The <strong>heap</strong> is a section of <strong>unmanaged</strong> memory (in Java, there's GC so technically it is managed there) that is allocated by the operating system. The OS uses the <code class=\"language-text\">sysbrk</code> syscall to allocate memory from the requesting function. Unlike the stack, memory is not invalidated when the function returns which leads to memory leaks. To avoid this, in C you would release memory with <code class=\"language-text\">free()</code> after a call to <code class=\"language-text\">malloc()</code> or one of its variants. Heap grows <strong>upward</strong> towards higher memory addresses.</p>\n<h3>Stack</h3>\n<p>This refers to the region of memory that is allocated to the process <strong>primarily to implement functions</strong>. This is managed in the sense that the variables created remain local to the function it resides and is invalidated once the function exits (when the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_register\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stack pointer</a> moves up). The values are still there, but they will be overwritten by the contents of the next function call's <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10057443/explain-the-concept-of-a-stack-frame-in-a-nutshell\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stack frame</a>. Two x86 registers that deal with this are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">esp</code> (extended stack pointer) - points to the top of the stack where <code class=\"language-text\">push</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">pop</code> will decrement and increment the stack pointer respectively. <code class=\"language-text\">push</code> adds an element to the top of the stack while <code class=\"language-text\">pop</code> removes the element at the top of the stack.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">ebp</code> (extended base pointer) - points to the start of the current <strong>stack frame</strong>, which is the space allocated for a function call. The <code class=\"language-text\">call</code> instruction pushes the current instruction pointer onto the stack.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that the stack grows <strong>downward</strong> towards lower memory addresses. This is also where global and static variables are declared.</p>\n<h3 id=\"registers\">Registers</h3>\n<p>These are small storage units located directly in the processor for quick access to intermediate values in function calls. It is known as L0 cache and it is located at the highest level in the <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-hierarchy-design-and-its-characteristics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">memory hierarchy</a>.</p>\n<p>There are six 32-bit general purpose registers in the x86 architecture <a href=\"#references\">[3]</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">eax</code> (extended accumulator register) - used for storing return values for functions and special register for certain calculations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">mov <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token number\">3</span>  <span class=\"token comment\">; Set eax to 3</span>\nret <span class=\"token comment\">; Return</span></code></pre></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ebx</code> (extended base register) - often set to commonly used values to speed up calculations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ecx</code> (extended counter register) - used as a function parameter or a loop counter. Generally used with <em>for loops</em> as the counter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">edx</code> (extended data register) - also used as a function parameter register like <code class=\"language-text\">ecx</code> and storing <strong>short-term variables</strong> within a function.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">esi</code> (extended source index register) - register that points to the where the \"source\" is located in memory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">edi</code> (extended data index register) - similar to <code class=\"language-text\">esi</code>, but it points to the destination. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ebp</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">esp</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">eip</code> are all known as <strong>reserved</strong> registers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"instructions\">Instructions</h2>\n<h3>Format</h3>\n<p>There are essentially two schools of thought for instruction format: the <strong>AT&#x26;T syntax</strong> and the <strong>Intel syntax</strong>.</p>\n<p>In short, the difference is that for the <strong>AT&#x26;T syntax</strong>, the source register is on the left side and the destination register is on the right side while it is the opposite for the <strong>Intel syntax</strong>.</p>\n<p>Instructions typically follow 2 forms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">op arg</code> - there is an operation with only one argument specified.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">op arg1, arg2</code> - there is an operation with two arguments specified, separated by a comma.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As an example with the <code class=\"language-text\">mov</code> instruction, it copies the value that is stored by the second argument into the first argument.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">mov arg1, arg2</code></pre></div>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/public/images/x86/x86-add.PNG\" alt=\"syntax\"></p>\n<p>Although it is called <code class=\"language-text\">mov</code>, it actually <strong>copies</strong> instead, meaning that the value stored in <code class=\"language-text\">arg2</code> is actually still there. However, there are some caveats with this specific instruction in general discussed in the next section.</p>\n<h3>Dereferencing</h3>\n<p>The caveat comes when you are trying to get values from the stack.</p>\n<p>When you are trying to get values from the stack, let's say moving a local variable at <code class=\"language-text\">ebp - 12 (0xC)</code> with a value of 42, you would expect that you would get the value that is stored at that location into <code class=\"language-text\">eax</code>. This means that <code class=\"language-text\">eax</code> should have the value of 42 right?</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">mov <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token register variable\">ebp</span><span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token number\">0xC</span></code></pre></div>\n<p><strong>WRONG</strong></p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">ebp - 0xC</code> is an address that refers to where 42 is stored in memory. Simply calling <code class=\"language-text\">mov</code> will move that address into <code class=\"language-text\">eax</code>, but not 42. If you know C, you know that we would need to <strong>dereference</strong> a pointer to get the value at that location. In x86, a similar idea also exists where we can think of using the square bracket notation as a dereference operator.</p>\n<p>So to get 42, we would run this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">mov <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">ebp</span><span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token number\">0xC</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/public/images/x86/x86-deref.PNG\" alt=\"dereferencing\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"math\">Math</h2>\nOf course, x86 supports the basic mathematical operators that you would need to perform more complex computations.\n<p><strong>Addition</strong></p>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">add</code> instruction is a binary operation that adds two given registers with the format <code class=\"language-text\">add arg1, arg2</code> which is the same as <code class=\"language-text\">arg1 = arg1 + arg2</code>. The first and second arguments are summed and stored in the first argument.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">add <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token number\">0x5</span></code></pre></div>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/public/images/x86/x86-add.PNG\" alt=\"adding\"></p>\n<p>The instruction above adds the value in <code class=\"language-text\">%eax</code> with 5 and stores it back in <code class=\"language-text\">%eax</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Subtraction</strong></p>\n<p>This is a binary operation that subtracts the second argument from the first: <code class=\"language-text\">sub arg1, arg2</code> is the same as <code class=\"language-text\">arg1 = arg1 - arg2</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">sub <span class=\"token register variable\">esp</span>, <span class=\"token number\">0x4</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The instruction above moves the stack pointer down 4 bytes.\nThis can also be done by adding a negative value with a lower overhead.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/public/images/x86/x86-sub.PNG\" alt=\"subtracting\"></p>\n<p><strong>Multiplication</strong></p>\n<p>Multiplication is a bit more complex since it comes with several varying instructions.\nAlso, its destination register varies depending on the memory size of the value you are multiplying with.</p>\n<p>*Note: The terminology here is different than with other architectures. A <strong>word</strong> is 16 bits (size of the register) and a <strong>doubleword</strong> is 32 bits.*</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Multiplying 2 bytes</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>This is a common case where we move one of the operands into register <code class=\"language-text\">%AX</code>. Then, we call <code class=\"language-text\">mul &lt;arg2&gt;</code> which would perform <code class=\"language-text\">%AX = %AX * arg2</code>, where <code class=\"language-text\">arg2</code> is some register and <strong>not</strong> an immediate.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<p>Multiplying 2 words (16 bits)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This operation performs multiplication with two 16 bit values.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The multiplicand, or number being multiplied, is stored in the <code class=\"language-text\">%AX</code> register and the multiplier is a word stored in memory or another register.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The syntax is similar to before, where we call <code class=\"language-text\">mul &lt;arg2&gt;</code> which performs <code class=\"language-text\">%(DX:AX) = %AX &amp; arg2</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The result is actually stored in two registers. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Since this allows for much larger results, the product of two words can result in a doubleword, which means it needs two registers to store the entire result.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">%DX</code> holds the upper 16 bits of the result while <code class=\"language-text\">%AX</code> holds the bottom 16 bits.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Multiplying 2 doublewords (32 bits)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The idea is similar here, but we use the <strong>extended</strong> versions of registers such as <code class=\"language-text\">%EAX</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">%EDX</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This is also called as <code class=\"language-text\">mul &lt;arg2&gt;</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the result of this could be a <code class=\"language-text\">qword</code> or <strong>quadword</strong>, so we would need to use 2 <em>extended</em> registers to store the result.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">%(EDX:EAX) = %EAX * arg2</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Both <code class=\"language-text\">%EDX</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">%EAX</code> store 32 bits.</li>\n<li>Like before, <code class=\"language-text\">%EDX</code> stores the upper 32 bits and <code class=\"language-text\">%EAX</code> stores the lower 32 bits.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Of course there is <code class=\"language-text\">imul</code>, which handles <strong>signed multiplication</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Division</strong></p>\n<p>Like with multiplication, division also has the same rules for dealing with different size divisors</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Divisor is 1 byte</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>First, we place our dividend (number we are dividing into) in <code class=\"language-text\">%AX</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The divisor is then another register or memory location we specify that has the divisor, so the operation works like this: <code class=\"language-text\">%AX / arg2</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The result will be stored in <strong>two</strong> registers: <code class=\"language-text\">%AL</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">%AH</code> which store the quotient and remainder respectively.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To perform this, call <code class=\"language-text\">div &lt;arg2&gt;</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Divisor is 1 word</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Here, the main difference is that the dividend (32 bits) is placed into the <code class=\"language-text\">%(DX:AX)</code> registers where the upper 16 bits are in <code class=\"language-text\">%DX</code> and the lower 16 bits are in <code class=\"language-text\">%AX</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After dividing, the 16-bit quotient goes into <code class=\"language-text\">%AX</code> and the 16-bit remainder goes into <code class=\"language-text\">%DX</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Divisor is a doubleword</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The dividend here is assumed to be 64 bits stored along the <code class=\"language-text\">%(EDX:EAX)</code> registers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After dividing, the quotient goes into <code class=\"language-text\">%EAX</code> and the remainder goes into <code class=\"language-text\">%EDX</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"stackops\">Stack Based Operations</h2>\nStack based operators are design to manipulate registers that correspond with the stack pointer, such as `%esp` and `%ebp`.\nKeep in mind that the stack pointer grows downward in memory, so the \"top\" of the stack is really at the bottom.\n<p><strong>Push</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">push</code> instruction is designed to put stuff on the top of the stack.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>How it accomplishes this is by decrementing <code class=\"language-text\">%esp</code> by 4 bytes (to allocate space for an address on 32 bit systems) and then places the value inside those 4 bytes.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">push &lt;arg&gt;</code></pre></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pop</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">pop</code> instruction is used to pop or remove data from the top of the stack pointed by <code class=\"language-text\">%esp</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This works by incrementing <code class=\"language-text\">%esp</code> by 4 bytes (on 32 bit systems) and copies the value to the corresponding register.</li>\n<li>\n<p>The actual data isn't cleared itself on the stack, but since the stack pointer is above it, the data will be overwritten the next time the stack pointer goes past there.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">pop &lt;register&gt;</code></pre></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/public/images/x86/x86-stack.PNG\" alt=\"stack\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"lea\">Lea</h2>\nThis instruction stands for **load effective address**.\n<p>It places the address of the corresponding value specified in the second argment and places it into the register specified by the first argument.</p>\n<p>The instruction was mainly included to add support to higher level languages like C where it wants the address of some value whether they are arrays or structs. It would be equivalent to the <code class=\"language-text\">&amp;</code> operator in C.\nLet's say we have a struct defined in C like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"c\"><pre class=\"language-c\"><code class=\"language-c\"><span class=\"token keyword\">struct</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Point</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">int</span> x<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">int</span> y<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">int</span> z<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>If we were to access the the z coordinate of an array of <code class=\"language-text\">Points</code> inside some for loop, we would run something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"c\"><pre class=\"language-c\"><code class=\"language-c\"><span class=\"token keyword\">int</span> z <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> points<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>i<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>z<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>In x86, the equivalent statement would be:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">MOV <span class=\"token register variable\">EDX</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">EBX</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token register variable\">EAX</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>Recall that the <code class=\"language-text\">MOV</code> instruction is used for moving values from the second argument to the first.</li>\n<li>The brackets are used as a <em>dereference</em> operator to get the associated value at that address.</li>\n<li>We are assuming that <code class=\"language-text\">%EBX</code> contains the base address of the array and <code class=\"language-text\">%EAX</code> contains the counter variable.</li>\n<li>Assuming a <strong>4-byte alignment</strong>, we multiply the counter <code class=\"language-text\">%EAX</code> by <code class=\"language-text\">12</code> since the <code class=\"language-text\">Point</code> struct has a size of <code class=\"language-text\">12</code> bytes (from 3 32-bit integers).</li>\n<li>\n<p>The offset to get the <code class=\"language-text\">z</code> variable is <code class=\"language-text\">8</code> bytes since there are 2 preceding integers, <code class=\"language-text\">x</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">y</code>.\nNow that's great for getting the value we want, but what if we just wanted the actual address in memory.\nIn C, the <code class=\"language-text\">&amp;</code> operator comes in handy and we can write something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"c\"><pre class=\"language-c\"><code class=\"language-c\"><span class=\"token keyword\">int</span><span class=\"token operator\">*</span> p <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;</span>points<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>i<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>z<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The code above will get the address of the <code class=\"language-text\">z</code> varible in the struct and store that in an int pointer <code class=\"language-text\">p</code>.\nBelow is the is the compiled version of the code, where we load the address into register <code class=\"language-text\">%ESI</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">LEA <span class=\"token register variable\">ESI</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">EBX</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> <span class=\"token register variable\">EAX</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span></code></pre></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/public/images/x86/x86-lea.PNG\" alt=\"load effective address\"></p>\n<p><strong>But Stan, Wait!</strong></p>\n<p><em>Can't we just do the same thing by writing <code class=\"language-text\">MOV ESI, EBX + 12 * EAX + 8</code>?</em></p>\n<p>Well no, we cannot. The explanation will be come clear after reading a <em>riveting</em> discussion on Stackoverflow spanning 2011 - 2018 <a href=\"#references\">[4]</a>.</p>\n<p>To simply put it, here are the main points of why that is not possible:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-text\">MOV</code> instruction is not designed for just calculating the address of a given memory location. Its job is to <strong>access</strong> whatever value is stored at that address, meaning it actually takes extra time to <strong>read</strong> the contents of that memory location. <code class=\"language-text\">LEA</code> just does the math on the given values.</li>\n<li>It is not valid to perform some form of computation without some brackets or parenthesis.</li>\n<li>Assuming that there is a specialized function for <code class=\"language-text\">MOV</code> that did allow for the line of code above, it would make the syntax less clean. It is subjective, but it is much easier to distiguish loading from memory and calculating an address if you have 2 different instructions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are probably more reasons, but in general, having a dedicated instruction for calculating addresses is a lot cleaner and more optimized than overloading an existing instruction which increases complexity and decreases readability.</p>\n<h2 id=\"compare\">Compare</h2>\nThe `cmp` instruction is actually the same as the `sub` instruction  except that instead of storing the result in the first first argument, it will set a **flag** in the processor.\nThe instruction can be executed as `cmp arg1, arg2`.\n<p>That <strong>flag</strong> will have these possible values:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">&lt; 0</code> - <code class=\"language-text\">arg1 &lt; arg2</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">0</code> - <code class=\"language-text\">arg1 == arg2</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">&gt; 0</code> - <code class=\"language-text\">arg1 &gt; arg2</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/public/images/x86/x86-cmp.PNG\" alt=\"compare\"></p>\n<p>The <strong>flag</strong> being stored is actually the value of <code class=\"language-text\">arg1 - arg2</code>.\nAs an example, this is how it would work:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">cmp <span class=\"token number\">1</span>, <span class=\"token number\">3</span></code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>This instruction would perform <code class=\"language-text\">1 - 3</code>, setting <code class=\"language-text\">-2</code> inside the flag which tells us that <code class=\"language-text\">arg1 &lt; arg2</code>.</li>\n<li>Keep in mind that this is not really a valid way since we cannot compare 2 immediates directly.</li>\n<li>The first argument is usually a register while the second one can either be an immediate or a register.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now there are many other examples of using the <code class=\"language-text\">cmp</code> instruction along with many other acceptable arguments, which can all be found here <a href=\"#references\">[5]</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump\">Jump</h2>\nTypically when using the `cmp` instruction above, it is followed by a `jmp` or **jump** instruction. This instruction takes in a single argument for the jump address as its parameter.\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">jmp addr</code></pre></div>\n<p>The jump will be taken based on the value of the <strong>flag</strong> in the processor. When a jump is taken, the <code class=\"language-text\">eip</code> register is set is set to that argument. Of course, there are many variants of the jump instruction that change the flow of the program based on the value of the <strong>flag</strong>. The <code class=\"language-text\">jmp</code> instruction shown above is the <strong>unconditional jump</strong>.</p>\n<p>Below is a non-exhaustive list of the different jump instructions that exist. These are mainly the common ones.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">je</code> (jump equal) - jumps if equal</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">jz</code> (jump zero) - jump if zero</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">jl</code> (jump less) - jump if less</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">jg</code> (jump greater) - jump if greater</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are plenty more that can be found <a href=\"http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/x86-jumps.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> <a href=\"#references\">[6]</a>.</p>\n<p>Below is an example program written in pseudocode on how it may work. Addresses are on the left and instructions are on the right, assume that the <code class=\"language-text\">eip</code> points to <code class=\"language-text\">addr3</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">addr1 instr1\naddr2 cmp <span class=\"token number\">1</span>, <span class=\"token number\">3</span>\naddr3 jl addr10\naddr4 instr4\n...   ...\naddr10 instr10</code></pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>Looking at the example above, the jump would be taken to <code class=\"language-text\">addr10</code> since <code class=\"language-text\">1 &lt; 3</code> and we are using <code class=\"language-text\">jl</code>, meaning jump if the first argument is less than the second.</li>\n<li>If we used <code class=\"language-text\">jg</code>, the <code class=\"language-text\">eip</code> would move to <code class=\"language-text\">addr4</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now you may have noticed that I used the word <strong>flag</strong> a lot in the last two sections, but what the heck is it?</p>\n<p>The idea of the <strong>FLAGS</strong> register is to serve as a status register that contains the <strong>current state of the processor</strong>. This essentially means that this <code class=\"language-text\">16 bit</code> wide register holds a lot of information as to what is going on in the processor.</p>\n<p>If the entire state of the CPU is stored in a single register, how do we keep track of multiple independent states?</p>\n<p>The idea of using a single register is to save space. Luckily through <strong>bitmasking</strong>, we can specify a specific set of bit(s) to represent the state of a certain piece of information. In short, each flag or state information is mapped to a specific set of bits. Confusing right?</p>\n<p>For example, let's say if we are performing some addition and a carry value has been generated by the ALU, the <strong>carry flag</strong> or <code class=\"language-text\">CF</code> is set to <code class=\"language-text\">1</code> to let us know that this has happened. This <code class=\"language-text\">1</code> is just 1 of the bits in the 16-bit register representing the state. To get the value of <code class=\"language-text\">CF</code> specifically, we use a mask value of <code class=\"language-text\">0x0001</code>, meaning that the <strong>least significant bit</strong> corresponds to the carry flag.</p>\n<p>The most common flags that are seen are typically <code class=\"language-text\">CF</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">ZF</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">OF</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">PF</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">SF</code>. Since this is only a brief overview, you can see a much more detailed breakdown of the x86 flags <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAGS_register\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> <a href=\"#references\">[7]</a>.</p>\n<p>FLAGS register is not limited to just <code class=\"language-text\">16</code> bits, as some processors have 32 bit and 64 bit register sizes. The 32-bit variant is denoted as EFLAGS while the 64-bit variant is denoted as RFLAGS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"call\">Call</h2>\nPerhaps this is the most important instruction of them all. It is a simple instruction on the surface that takes in a single argument.\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">call <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>func_addr<span class=\"token operator\">></span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This is designed to \"call\" a function in a program or library. When you disassemble your C program, you will notice that calls made to standard C library functions like <code class=\"language-text\">printf</code> all point to some memory address.</p>\n<p>The way that <code class=\"language-text\">call</code> works is that it pushes the return address, or the current value of <code class=\"language-text\">eip</code>, onto the stack and jumps to the argument.</p>\n<p>In other words, this means that <code class=\"language-text\">call &lt;func_addr&gt;</code> is equivalent to:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">push eip\njmp func</code></pre></div>\n<p>What this does is create the <strong>stack frame</strong> which in essence places all the parameters, the return address, and the function itself in the right order on the <strong>stack</strong> so it can execute and return to the caller. Every single function that is called will have its own stack frame, where the base pointer <code class=\"language-text\">ebp</code> contains the start of the stack frame and the <code class=\"language-text\">esp</code> points to the top of the stack frame.</p>\n<p>To call a function with parameters, it would look something like this. This is what <code class=\"language-text\">foo(a, b, c)</code> would look like in x86:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">push c\npush b\npush a\ncall foo</code></pre></div>\n<p>Note that we always push in reverse order since a stack is <strong>LIFO</strong>. Recall that all the parameters are stored on the <strong>stack</strong>. To access them, we can write something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">pop <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">esp</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">; Return address</span>\npop <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">esp</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">; Parameter 'a'</span>\npop <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">esp</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">; Paramater 'b'</span>\npop <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">esp</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">; Parameter 'c'</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Realistically, we are missing the stack base-pointer register, which helps us keep track of where the start of the stack frame is located since handling functions without it can be quite messy.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">pop <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">ebp</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">16</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">; Parameter 'c'</span>\npop <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">ebp</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">12</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">; Parameter 'b'</span>\npop <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">ebp</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">; Parameter 'a'</span>\npop <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">ebp</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">; Return address</span>\npop <span class=\"token register variable\">eax</span>, <span class=\"token operator\">[</span><span class=\"token register variable\">ebp</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token operator\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">; Saved stack base-pointer register</span></code></pre></div>\n<h2 id=\"leave\">Leave/Ret</h2>\nThese two instructions are always used at the end of a given function. The `leave` instruction is always followed by the `return` instruction as seen in disassembling C programs.\n<p>These two instructions make up what we know as today as a single <code class=\"language-text\">return</code> statement in higher level languages like Java or C. They must be used together as they <strong>clean up the stack frame</strong> and <strong>returns to the correct part of the program</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">leave\nret</code></pre></div>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">leave</code> instruction performs the clean up of the stack frame. It:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Shifts <code class=\"language-text\">esp</code> to where <code class=\"language-text\">ebp</code> is located, which is the base of the stack frame for the current function (callee).</li>\n<li>Pops from the top of the stack into <code class=\"language-text\">ebp</code>, which holds the address of the old stack frame (caller).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In x86, it is <code class=\"language-text\">leave</code> is equivalent to this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"nasm\"><pre class=\"language-nasm\"><code class=\"language-nasm\">movl <span class=\"token register variable\">ebp</span>, <span class=\"token register variable\">esp</span>\npopl <span class=\"token register variable\">ebp</span></code></pre></div>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/public/images/x86/x86-leave.PNG\" alt=\"leave\"></p>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-text\">return</code> instruction takes the value at the top of the stack after <code class=\"language-text\">leave</code> is called, which is the return address to the caller, and pops it into <code class=\"language-text\">esp</code>. In the end, the program continues executing where it left off in the caller function.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spiderpig86/blog/master/public/images/x86/x86-ret.PNG\" alt=\"return\"></p>\n<h2>It's time for me to leave and ret</h2>\n<p>Understanding x86 is crucial in understanding and developing future exploits of your own. I really hope this helped to make x86 seem a little less scary.</p>\n<p>There is of course a lot more to learn, but this should lay the ground work for future research.
